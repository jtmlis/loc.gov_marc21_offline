<h3><a name="one">1. Introduction</a></h3>

1.1. The MARC 21 formats are standards for the
     representation and communication of
     bibliographic and related information in machine-readable form.
<p>
<dl>
<dt>1.2. A MARC record involves three elements: the
     record <strong>structure</strong>, the <strong>content designation</strong>, and
     the data <strong>content</strong> of the record.<br>

<dd><p>1.2.1.  The <strong>structure</strong> of MARC records is an
          implementation of national and international
          standards, e.g.,  <em>Information Interchange
          Format</em> (ANSI Z39.2) and <em>Format for
          Information Exchange</em> (ISO 2709).<p>
1.2.2.    <strong>Content designation</strong>, the codes and
          conventions established to identify explicitly
          and characterize further the data elements
          within a record and to support the
          manipulation of those data, is defined in the
          MARC 21 formats.<p>
1.2.3.    The <strong>content</strong> of most data elements is defined
          by standards outside the formats, e.g., <em>Anglo-American Cataloguing
Rules</em>, <em>Library of
          Congress Subject Headings</em>, <em>National Library
          of Medicine Classification</em>.  The content of
          other data elements, e.g., coded data section 9 below), is defined in the MARC 21
          formats.
<p>

<dt>1.3. A MARC 21 format is a set of codes and content
     designators defined for encoding  machine-readable records.  Formats are defined for five
     types of data: bibliographic, holdings, authority,
     classification, and community information.<br>
<dd><p>1.3.1.    <em>MARC 21 Format for Bibliographic Data</em>
          contains format specifications for encoding
          data elements needed to describe, retrieve, and
          control various forms of bibliographic
          material.  The <em>MARC 21 Format for
          Bibliographic Data</em> is an integrated format
          defined for the identification and description of
          different forms of bibliographic material. 
          MARC 21 specifications are defined for
          books, serials, computer files, maps, music,
          visual materials, and mixed material.  With
          the full integration of the previously discrete
          bibliographic formats, consistent definition
          and usage are maintained for different forms
          of material.<p>
1.3.2.    <em>MARC 21 Format for Holdings Data</em> contains
          format specifications for encoding data
          elements pertinent to holdings and location
          data for all forms of material.  <p>
1.3.3.    <em>MARC 21 Format for Authority Data</em> contains
          format specifications for encoding data
          elements that identify or control the content
          and content designation of those portions of a
          bibliographic record that may be subject to
          authority control.<p>
1.3.4.    <em>MARC 21 Format for Classification Data</em>
          contains format specifications for encoding
          data elements related to classification numbers
          and the captions associated with them. 
          Classification records are used for the
          maintenance and development of classification
          schemes.<p>
1.3.5.    <em>MARC 21 Format for Community Information</em>
          provides format specifications for records
          containing information about events,
          programs, services, etc. so that this
          information can be integrated into the same
          public access catalogs as data in other record
          types.
<p>

<dt>1.4. The MARC 21 formats are maintained by the
     Library of Congress in consultation with various
     user communities.<br>
<dd><p>1.4.1.    Through maintenance and revision, content
          designation is added to and existing content
          designation is made obsolete or deleted from
          formats.  Content designation is made obsolete
          when it is found to be no longer appropriate or
          when the data element involved is no longer
          needed.  An obsolete content designator may
          continue to appear in records created prior to
          the date it was made obsolete.  Obsolete
          content designators are not used in new
          records.  A deleted content designator is one
          that had been reserved in MARC 21 but had
          not been defined or one that had been defined
          but it is known with near certainty that it had
          not been used.<p>  
1.4.2.    The principles stated in this document have
          developed over time.  The formats contain
          exceptions to the principles due to early format
          development decisions.  While many
          exceptions have been made obsolete, others
          remain because of the need to maintain upward
          compatibility of the formats in current
          development.</dl>

<p>

<h3><a name="two">2. General Considerations</a></h3>

2.1. The MARC 21 formats are communication
     formats, primarily designed to provide
     specifications for the exchange of bibliographic
     and related information between systems.  They
     are widely used in a variety of exchange and
     processing environments.  As communication
     formats, they do not mandate internal storage or
     display formats to be used by individual systems.
<p>

2.2. The MARC 21 formats, particularly the
     bibliographic and authority formats, were initially
     developed to enable the Library of Congress to
     communicate its catalog records to other
     institutions.  The formats have had a close
     relationship to the needs and practices of North
     American libraries with universal collections. 
     They reflect both the various cataloging codes
     applied in the library community and the
     requirements of the archives community.
<p>

2.3. The MARC 21 formats were designed to facilitate
     the exchange of bibliographic and related
     information.  An attempt has been made to
     preserve compatiblity with other national and
     international formats, e.g., UKMARC and
     UNIMARC.
<p>

2.4. National agencies in the United States and Canada
     (Library of Congress, National Agricultural
     Library, National Library of Medicine, United
     States Government Printing Office, and National
     Library of Canada) are given special emphasis
     and consideration in the formats because they
     serve as sources of authoritative cataloging and as
     agencies responsible for certain data elements.
<p>
<dl>
<dt>2.5. The institutions responsible for the content,
     content designation, and transcription accuracy of
     bibliographic and authority data within a
     MARC record are identified at the record
     level in field 008/39 (Fixed-Length Data
     Elements--Cataloging source) and in field 040
     (Cataloging Source).  This responsibility may be
     evaluated in terms of the following rule.<br>

<dd><p>2.5.1.    Responsible Parties Rule:<p>
<blockquote>2.5.1.1.  Unmodified records--The institution
          identified as the cataloging institution (field
          040$a) is considered responsible for data
          content in the record except for agency-assigned data (see section 2.5.2.1. below). 
          The institution identified as the transcribing
          institution (field 040$c) is considered
          responsible for <strong>content designation</strong> and
          <strong>transcription</strong> accuracy for all data.<p>

2.5.1.2.  Modified records--Institutions identified as
          cataloging or modifying institutions (field
          040$a,$d) are considered collectively
          responsible for data content in the record
          except for agency-assigned and authoritative-agency data (see section 2.5.2. below). 
          Institutions identified as transcribing or
          modifying institutions (field 040$c,$d) are
          considered collectively responsible for
          <strong>content designation</strong> and <strong>transcription</strong>
          accuracy.</blockquote>
<p>
2.5.2.    Exceptions to Responsible Parties Rule:<br>
<blockquote>
2.5.2.1.  Certain data elements are defined in the
          MARC 21 formats as being exclusively
          assigned by particular agencies, e.g.,
          International Standard Serial Number (field
          022), Library of Congress Control Number
          (field 010).  The content of such <strong>agency-assigned</strong> elements is
always the
          responsibility of the agency.<p>

2.5.2.2.  Certain data elements have been defined in
          the MARC 21 formats in relation to one or
          more <strong>authoritative</strong> agencies that maintain
          the lists or rules upon which the data is
          based, e.g., Library of Congress Call
          Number (field 050), National Library of
          Medicine Call Number (field 060).  Where
          it is possible for other agencies to create
          similar or identical content for these data
          elements, content designation may be
          provided to distinguish between content
          actually assigned by the authoritative agency
          and that assigned by other agencies.  In the
          former case, responsibility for content rests
          with the authoritative agency.  In the latter
          case, the Responsible Parties Rule applies,
          and no further identification of the assigning
          agency is provided.
</blockquote>
</dl>



<p>
<dl>
<dt>2.6. The MARC 21 bibliographic format provides
     content designation only for data that are
     applicable to all copies of the bibliographic entity
     described.<br>
<dd><p>2.6.1.    Information which applies only to some copies
          (or even to a single copy) of a title may be of
          interest beyond the institutions holding such
          copies. The MARC 21 formats provide limited
          content designation for the encoding of this
          information and for identifying the holding
          institution, e.g., subfield $5 in the 700-740
          added entry fields in the bibliographic format.<p>

2.6.2.    Information that does not apply to all copies of
          a title, and is not of interest to other
          institutions, is coded in local fields. For
          instance, the 59X block is reserved for local
          notes in the bibliographic format (see section
          6.7. below).</dl>
<p>

2.7. Although a MARC record is usually
     autonomous, data elements are provided that
     contain information used to link related records. 
     These linkages may be implicit, through identical
     access points in each record, or explicit, through
     a linking entry field.  The 76X-78X linking entry
     fields in the bibliographic format may contain
     either selected data elements that identify the
     related item or a control number that identifies
     the related record.  In addition, an explicit code
     in the leader identifies a record that is linked to
     another record through a control number.
<p>

<h3><a name="three">3. Structural Features</a></h3>

3.1. The MARC 21 formats are an imple-mentation of
     the<em> Information Interchange Format</em> (ANSI
     Z39.2).  The formats also incorporate other
     relevant ANSI standards.
<p>

3.2. All information in a MARC record is stored in
     character form.  MARC communications
     records are coded in Extended ASCII, as defined
     in the <em>MARC 21 Specifications for Record
     Structure, Character Sets, and Exchange Media</em>.
<p>

3.3. The length of each variable field can be
     determined either from the <strong>length-of-field</strong> portion
     of the directory entry or from the occurrence of
     the <strong>field terminator</strong> character [1E(16), 8-bit].  The
     length of a record can be determined either from
     the <strong>logical record length</strong> element in Leader/00-04 or from the
occurrence of the <strong>record
     terminator</strong> character [1D(16), 8-bit].  The location
     of each variable field is explicitly stated in the
     <strong>starting character position</strong> element in its
     directory entry.
<p>

<h3><a name="four">4. Content Designation</a></h3>

4.1. The goal of content designation is to identify and
     characterize the data elements that comprise a
     MARC record with sufficient precision to
     support manipulation of the data for a variety of
     functions.<p>

<dl><dt>4.2. MARC content designation is designed to
     support functions that include:<br>
<dd ><p>4.2.1.    Display--the formatting of data for screen
          display, for printing on 3x5 cards or in book
          catalogs, for production of COM catalogs, or
          for other visual presentation of the data.<p>

4.2.2.    Information retrieval--the identification,
          categorization, and retrieval of any identifiable
          data element in a record.</dl>

<P>
4.3. Some fields serve multiple functions.  For
     example, field 245 (Title Statement) serves both
     as the bibliographic transcription of the title and
     the statement of responsibility and as an access
     point for the title.
<p>
4.4. The MARC 21 formats provide for display
     constants.  A display constant is a term, phrase,
     and/or spacing or punctuation convention that
     may be system generated under prescribed
     circumstances to make a visual presentation of
     data in a record more meaningful to a user.  Such
     display constants are not carried in the data, but
     may be supplied for display by the processing
     system.  For example, subfield $x in Series
     Statement field 490 (and in some other fields)
     implies the display constant <em>ISSN</em>; also, the
     combination of tag 780 (Preceding Entry) and
     second indicator value 2 implies the display
     constant <em>Supersedes</em>.
<p>

4.5. The MARC 21 formats support the sorting of
     data only to a limited extent.  In general, sorting
     must be accomplished through the application of
     external algorithms to the data.
<p>
<h3><a name="five">5. Organization of the Record</a></h3>

5.1. A MARC record consists of three main
     sections: the <strong>leader</strong>, the <strong>directory</strong>, and the
     <strong>variable fields</strong>.
<p>

5.2. The <strong>leader</strong> consists of data elements that contain
     coded values and are identified by relative
     character position.  Data elements in the leader
     define parameters for processing the record.  The
     leader is fixed in length (24 characters) and
     occurs at the beginning of each MARC record.
<p>

5.3. The <strong>directory</strong> contains the tag, starting location,
     and length of each field within the record. 
     Directory entries for variable control fields
     appear first, in ascending tag order.  Entries for
     variable data fields follow, arranged in ascending
     order according to the first character of the tag. 
     The order of the fields in the record does not
     necessarily correspond to the order of directory
     entries.  Duplicate tags are distinguished only by 
     location of the respective fields within the record. 
     The length of the directory entry is defined in the
     entry map elements in Leader/20-23.  In the
     MARC 21 formats, the length of a directory entry
     is 12 characters.  The directory ends with a <strong>field
     terminator</strong> character.
<p>

5.4. The data content of a record is divided into
     <strong>variable fields</strong>.  The MARC 21 formats
     distinguish two types of variable fields: <strong>variable
     control fields</strong> and <strong>variable data fields</strong>.  Control
     and data fields are distinguished only by structure
     (see sections 7 and 8 below). The term <strong>fixed
     fields</strong> is occasionally used in MARC 21
     documentation, referring either to control fields
     generally or to specific coded-data fields, e.g.,
     007 (Physical Description Fixed Field) or 008
     (Fixed-Length Data Elements).
<p>

<h3><a name="six">6. Variable Fields and Tags</a></h3>

6.1. The data in a MARC record is organized into
     fields, each identified by a three-character tag.
<p>

6.2. According to ANSI Z39.2, the tag must consist of
     alphabetic or numeric ASCII graphic characters,
     i.e., decimal integers 0-9 or letters A-Z
     (uppercase or lowercase, but not both).  The
     MARC 21 formats have used only numeric tags.
<p>

6.3. The tag is stored in the directory entry for the
     field, not in the field itself.
<p>
<dl>
<dt>6.4. Variable fields are grouped into blocks according
     to the first character of the tag, which identifies
     the function of the data within a record, e.g.,
     main entry, added entry, subject entry.  The type
     of information in the field, e.g., personal name,
     corporate name, or title, is identified by the
     remainder of the tag.<br>

<dt>
6.5. Certain blocks in the MARC 21 formats contain
     data which may be subject to authority control
     (1XX, 4XX, 6XX, 7XX, 8XX for bibliographic
     records; 1XX, 4XX, 5XX, 7XX for authority
     records, etc.).<br>

<dd><p>
6.5.1.    In these blocks, certain parallels of content
          designation are preserved.  The following
         meanings are generally given to the final two
          characters of the tag:<p>
<blockquote>X00 = Personal names<br>
                    X10 = Corporate names<br>
                    X11 = Meeting names<br>
                    X30 = Uniform titles<br>
                    X40 = Bibliographic titles<br>
                    X50 = Topical terms<br>
                    X51 = Geographic names<p>

               Further content designation (indicators and
               subfield codes) for data elements subject to
               authority control are defined consistently
               across the bibliographic and authority formats. 
               These guidelines apply only to the main range
               of fields in each block, not to secondary
               ranges, e.g., the linking entry fields 760-787
               in the bibliographic format.</blockquote><p>

6.5.2.    Within fields subject to authority control, data
          elements may exist which are not subject to
          authority control and which may vary from
          record to record containing the same heading,
          e.g., subfield $e, Relator term.<p>
 
6.5.3.    In fields not subject to authority control, each
          tag is defined independently.  Parallel
          meanings have been preserved whenever
          possible.

<p>

<dt>6.6. Principles have been established to assist in
     determining when a separate field should be
     defined for note data and when the data should be
     included in a general note field.<br>
<dd><p>6.6.1.    In the MARC 21 bibliographic format, a
          specific 5XX note field is defined when at
          least one of the following is true:<p>

<blockquote>6.6.1.1.  Categorical indexing or retrieval is required
          on the data defined for the note.  The note is
          used for structured access purposes but does
          not have the nature of a controlled access
          point.<p>

6.6.1.2.  Special manipulation of that specific category
          of data is a routine requirement.  Such
          manipulation includes special print/display
          formatting or selection/suppression from
          display or printed product.
<p>
6.6.1.3.  Specialized structuring of information for
          reasons other than those given in (a) or (b),
          e.g., to support particular standards of data
          content when they cannot be supported in
          existing fields.</blockquote><p>

6.6.2.    In the MARC 21 authority format, the
          specifications for notes are covered in the
          following two conditions:

<p><blockquote>
6.6.2.1.  A specific note field is needed when special
          manipulation of that specific category of data
          is a routine requirement.  Such manipulation
          includes special print/display formatting or 
          selection/suppression from display or printed
          product.
<p>
6.6.2.2.  Multiple notes are generally not established
          to accommodate the same type of
          information for different types of authorities. 
          Notes are thus not differentiated by or
          limited to subject, name, or series if the
          same information applies to more than one
          type.</blockquote><p>



<dt>6.7. Certain tags have been reserved for local
     implementation.  The MARC 21 formats specify
     no structure or meaning for local fields. 
     Communication of local fields between systems
     is governed by mutual agreements on the content
     and content designation of the fields
     communicated.<br>
<dd><p>
6.7.1.    The 9XX block is reserved for local
          implementation.
<p>
6.7.2.    In general, any tag containing the character 9
          is reserved for local implementation within the
          block structure (see section 6.4. above).<p>

6.7.3.    The historical development of the MARC 21
          formats has left one exception to this general
          principle:  field 490 (Series Statement) in the
          bibliographic format.  There are several
          obsolete fields with tags containing the
          character 9.<p></dl>


6.8. Theoretically, all fields, except field 001 (Control
     Number), 003 (Control Number Identifier) and
     field 005 (Date and Time of Latest Transaction),
     may be repeated.  The nature of the data,
     however, often precludes repetition.  For
     example, a bibliographic record may contain only
     one field 245 (Title Statement) and an authority
     record may contain only one 1XX heading field. 
     The repeatability/nonrepeatability of each field is
     defined in the MARC 21 formats.

<p>
<h3><a name="seven">7.   Variable Control Fields</a></h3>

7.1. The 00X fields in the MARC 21 formats are
     variable control fields.
<p>

7.2. Variable control fields consist of data and a field
     terminator.  They  contain neither indicators nor
     subfield codes (see sections 8.3 and 8.4 below).
<p>

7.3. Variable control fields contain either a single data
     element or a series of fixed-length data elements
     identified by relative character position.
<p>

<h3><a name="eight">8. Variable Data Fields</a></h3>

8.1. All fields except 00X are variable data fields.
<p>
<dl>
<dt>8.2. Four levels of content designation are provided
     for variable data fields in ANSI Z39.2:<br>
<dd><p>
8.2.1.    A three-character tag, stored in the directory
          entry.
<p>
8.2.2.    Indicators stored at the beginning of each
          variable data field, the number of indicators
          being reflected in Leader/10 (Indicator count).
<p>
8.2.3.    Subfield codes preceding each data element,
          the length of the code being reflected in
          Leader/11 (Subfield code count).
<p>
8.2.4.    A field terminator following the last data
          element in the field.<p>


<dt>8.3. Indicators<br>
<dd><p>
8.3.1.    Indicators contain values conveying
          information that interprets or  supplements the
          data found in the field.
<p>
8.3.2.    The MARC 21 formats specify two indicator
          positions at the beginning of each variable data
          field.
<p>
8.3.3.    Indicators are defined independently for each
          field.  Parallel meanings are preserved
          whenever possible.
<p>
8.3.4.    Indicator values are interpreted independently;
          meaning is not ascribed to the two indicators
          taken together.
<p>
8.3.5.    Indicators may be any lowercase alphabetic or
          numeric character or a blank (#).  Numeric
          values are defined first.  A blank (#) is used in
          an undefined indicator position or to mean
          <em>information not provided</em> in a defined indicator
          position.  The blank may have specific
          meaning when necessary for upward
          compatibility.
<p>
8.3.6.    The value 9 is reserved for local
          implementation.<p>
<dt>8.4. Subfield Codes<br>
<dd><p>
8.4.1.    Subfield codes identify data elements within a
          field that require (or might require) separate
          manipulation.
<p>
8.4.2.    Subfield codes in the MARC 21 formats
          consist of two characters--a  delimiter [1F(16), 8-bit], followed by a data element
identifier.  A
          data element identifier may be any lowercase
          alphabetic or numeric character.<p>
<blockquote>8.4.2.1.  Numeric identifiers are defined for
          parametric data used to process the field, or
          coded data needed to interpret the field. 
          (Note that not all numeric identifiers defined
          in the past have followed this specification.)
<p>
8.4.2.2.  Alphabetic identifiers are defined for the
          separate elements that constitute the data
          content of the field.
<p>
8.4.2.3.  The character 9 and the following graphic
          symbols are reserved for local definition as
          data element identifiers:  ! &quot; # $ % &amp; '  ( )
          * + ' - . / : ; &lt; = &gt; ?</blockquote>
<p>
8.4.3.         Subfield codes are defined independently for
               each field.  Parallel  meanings are preserved
               whenever possible.
<p>
8.4.4.         Subfield codes are defined for purposes of
               identification, not arrangement.  The order
               of subfields is specified by content
               standards, e.g., cataloging rules.  In some
               cases, however, such specifications may be
               incorporated in the MARC 21 format
               documentation.
<p>
8.4.5.    Theoretically, all data elements may be
          repeated.  The nature of the data, however,
          often precludes repetition. The
          repeatability/nonrepeatability of each subfield
          code is defined in the MARC 21 formats.
</dl><p>

<h3><a name="nine">9.  Coded Data</a></h3>

9.1. In addition to content designation, the MARC 21
     formats include specifications for the content of
     certain data elements, particularly those that
     provide for the representation of data by coded
     values.
<p>
9.2. Coded values consist of fixed-length character
     strings.  Individual elements within a coded-data
     field or subfield are identified by relative
     character position.
<p>
9.3. Although coded data occur most frequently in the
     leader, directory, and variable control fields, any
     field or subfield may be defined for coded-data
     elements.
<p>
<dl>
<dt>9.4. Certain common values have been defined
     whenever applicable:
         <dd><P># -- Undefined (element not defined)<br>
          n -- Not applicable (element is not applicable to the
               item) <br>
          u -- Unknown (record creator was unable to
               determine value)<br>
          z -- Other (value other than those defined for the
               element)<br>
          | -- Fill character (record creator has chosen not to
               provide information)<p>
          Historical exceptions do occur in the formats.  In
          particular, the blank (#) often has been defined as
          not applicable or has been assigned a specific
                    meaning.</dl>
