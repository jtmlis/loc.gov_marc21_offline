      MARC 21: Harmonized USMARC and CAN/MARC </H2>              

<h3 align=center>Network Development and MARC Standards Office<br>Library of Congress</h3>


<hr>
<P>The Library of Congress and the National Library of Canada are
pleased to announce that the harmonized USMARC and CAN/MARC
formats will be published in a single edition in early 1999 under
a new name: <B>MARC 21</B>.  The name both points to the future as we
move into the <I>21st century</I> and suggests the international
character of the format, which is appropriate and important given
its expanding <I>worldwide use</I>.  

<P><B>MARC 21</B> is not a new format.  From 1994-1997 the USMARC and
CAN/MARC user communities worked to eliminate all remaining
differences in their two already-similar formats.  Compatibility
had been a feature of the development processes for both formats
for many years.  In 1997 and early 1998, updates to the formats
were issued that made the format specifications identical.  <B>MARC
21</B>, a continuation of both USMARC and CAN/MARC, publishes the
formats in one edition under a new name. 

<P>Further announcements on the publication of the new editions of
the five formats that make up the <B>MARC 21</B> family of formats --
Bibliographic, Authority, Holdings, Classification, and Community
Information -- will be made when printing of each is completed
over the next year.  The National Library of Canada will also be
producing simultaneously a French edition of <B>MARC 21</B>.  For
further information on the shared format, visit the following official format
