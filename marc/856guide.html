<h3><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h3>
<p>Field 856 in the MARC 21 bibliographic, holdings, authority, classification, 
  and community information formats is used for electronic location and access 
  information to an electronic resource. <br>
  <br>
  The field may be used in a bibliographic or holdings record for a resource when 
  it or a subset of it is available electronically. In addition, it may be used 
  to locate and access an electronic version of a non-electronic resource described 
  in either the bibliographic record, a portion of the resource described, or 
  a related electronic resource. See the <a href="856guide.html#other_formats">Field 856 in 
  Other Formats</a> section for information about how field 856 is used in the 
  authority, classification, and community information formats. <br>
  <br>
  Field 856 contains the following elements: </p>

<h3><strong><a name="gen_info">General Information</a></strong></h3>
<p>The data in field 856 may be a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), which is 
  recorded in subfield $u. The necessary locator information may also be parsed 
  into separate defined subfields. Note that separate subfields for locator data 
  was provided when this field was first established in 1993, but generally, these 
  are seldom used. An access method, or protocol used, is given as a value in 
  the first indicator position (if the access method is email, FTP, remote login 
  (telnet), dial-up, or HTTP) or in subfield $2 (if the access method is anything 
  else). The access method is the first element of a URL. The field may also include 
  a Uniform Resource Name or URN (e.g., a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) or handle). 
</p>
<p>See below for guidelines on repeatability.</p>
<p> <strong>Uniform Resource Identifier.</strong> For any access method, a Uniform 
  Resource Identifier (URI) is generally recorded in subfield $u. Separate subfields 
  may be used if it is desirable to display data in a particular way.<br>
  <br>
<dl> 
  <dt>The most commonly used data elements in field 856 are as follows: <br>
</dl>
<ul>
  <li>1st indicator = 4 for HTTP (earlier records may use blank)<br>
  </li>
  <li>Subfield $u = [HTTP URL]<br>
  </li>
  <li>Subfield $3: data specifying to what the URI refers, if applicable<br>
  </li>
  <li>Subfield $z (Public note): data relating to the electronic location of the 
    source that is adequate for public display </li>
</ul>
<p> <strong>Required subfields.</strong> A URI in subfield $u is required unless 
  electronic location and access information is parsed into separate subfields, 
  in which case no single subfield is required. When using this technique, the 
  subfields used largely depends on the access method indicated in the first indicator 
  or in subfield $2 (if first indicator = 7). 
<p> <strong>Encoding non-MARC characters.</strong> In February 1994, Proposal 
  93-10 defined additional characters in the MARC character set to both accommodate 
  existing bibliographic needs and to align it with the ASCII and ANSEL character 
  sets. Both the spacing underscore and the spacing tilde were added at the time 
  because of the need in directory and file names for electronic resources. Many 
  systems have implemented these characters. For systems that have not implemented 
  the spacing underscore and tilde, the following alternative characters may be 
  used: <br>

<dl> 
  <dd>spacing underscore %5F<br>
    spacing tilde %7E<br>
</dl>
Since these characters are valid ASCII strings, the above method allows for the 
functionality supported by Z39.50 clients and Web browsers which permit users 
to click on links to access resources represented by URLs. When the additions 
to the MARC 21 character set are implemented to support the encoding of the spacing 
characters, it will be possible to replace all instances of the %xx strings. 
<p> <strong>Multiple 856 fields</strong>. There are many reasons to include multiple 
  856 fields in records. The following are the most common: 
<ul>
  <li>Location data elements vary (the URI in subfield $u or subfields $a, $b, 
    $d, when used) 
  <li>Different access methods (e.g., a document available through HTTP and from 
    an FTP server)<br>
  <li>Different parts of the item are electronic, using subfield $3 to indicate 
    the part (e.g., table of contents accessible in one file and an abstract in 
    another)<br>
  <li>Mirror sites (the same resource is made available at two different locations, 
    often to facilitate access, perhaps internationally)<br>
  <li>Different formats/resolutions (e.g., the ASCII version of an electronic 
    journal vs. the Web home page for that journal; a thumbnail vs. archival copy 
    of a digitized photograph) 
  <li>Related items, using subfield $3 and second indicator value to specify 
</ul>
<p>See also under <a href="856guide.html#subfield_$u">subfield $u</a> for repeatability guidelines. 
<p><b>Field 856 in bibliographic or holdings records.</b> Since field 856 is valid 
  in both bibliographic and holdings records, institutions may favor recording 
  it in the holdings record. It is intended to be an electronic equivalent to 
  field 852 (Location), which contains information used to identify the holding 
  organization and other detailed information required to locate a physical item 
  in a collection. In early 1999, the Network Development and MARC Standards Office 
  elicited opinions on whether it is desirable to use the field in bibliographic 
  or holdings records. Responses received generally favored recording the field 
  in the holdings record where practical. However, for a variety of reasons, such 
  as the wider exchange of bibliographic records, many institutions use the bibliographic 
  record despite the benefits of using holdings records. <br>
  <br>
  The following advantages of using holdings records have been expressed:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Ownership to an electronic resource may vary by institution. Such access 
    information belongs in local holdings.<br>
  <li>The holdings record is a means to bring together various versions.<br>
  <li>Use of a single record approach for the bibliographic item has been implemented 
    widely. This practice makes it clearer to use holdings for the specific versions.<br>
  <li>Having a hot-linked 856 field in holdings forces users to think of it as 
    holdings information, and to separate information about the universal bibliographic 
    item.<br>
  <li>The "universal URL" that is for general access and any general information 
    on access in note fields should be in the bibliographic record. Specific local 
    access URLs should be in holdings (although this may result in unpredictability).<br>
  <li>Bibliographic field 856 might usefully be limited to links that do not apply 
    to the entire bibliographic item (e.g., finding aid, table of content, abstract). 
</ul>
<p> In order to move towards this approach in the future, it will be necessary 
  to persuade vendors to make the following changes to their ILS systems:<br>
<ul>
  <li> Allow for hot links from holdings records<br>
  <li>Allow for the ability to do link checking from holdings records<br>
  <li>Provide indexing of holdings records<br>
  <li> Allow for the ability to export the fields from holdings, to be exchanged 
    either as separate holdings records or embedded in an exported bibliographic 
    record<br>
  <li> Provide for more logical displays of bibliographic/holdings information 
    where necessary<br>
  <li> Allow for sequencing multiple holdings records 
</ul>
At this point, it is a local decision whether to use the field in bibliographic 
or holdings records.

<h3><a name="data_elements">Specific Data Elements</a></h3>
<dl> 
  <dt><strong>First Indicator (Access Method).</strong> The first indicator contains 
    information about the access method to the resource and has values defined 
    for Email, FTP, Remote login (Telnet), Dial-up, and HTTP. Access methods without 
    defined values may contain a first indicator value 7 with the method indicated 
    in subfield $2. Older records may contain value 7 and subfield $2 (with content 
    http) if created before value 4 (HTTP) was defined. 
    <p> The list of indicator values and the values used in subfield $2 is specified
       in the URL standard (<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1738.txt">RFC1738</a>)
        and maintained by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (<a href="http://www.iana.org/">IANA</a>).
 A list of URI schemes is online at: <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/uri-schemes.xhtml">http://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/uri-schemes.xhtml</a>.
    <p> For those access methods that have an indicator value defined (ftp, telnet, 
      electronic mail), the URI is included in subfield $u with the appropriate 
      indicator value recorded, even though it is redundant with the first element 
      of the URI. 
    <p> Value # (blank) (No information provided) may be used if only a URN is 
      recorded in subfield $u. If using a URI in subfield $u with one of the access 
      methods that has a value defined in the first indicator, the access method 
      may be repeated in subfield $2, if desired (e.g., 856 0# $umailto:<a href="http://www.loc.gov/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="44282d373037213632043622292c6a2b3623">[email&#160;protected]</a> 
      $2mailto).<br>
      <br>
    <p> Value 7 and subfield $2 is used for electronic access to host-specific 
      file names (i.e., files stored locally) with the access method, &quot;file.&quot; 
      This designation is also a defined URL scheme. 
    <p> <strong>Second indicator (Relationship).</strong> A second indicator is 
      provided to show the relationship between the information in field 856 and 
      the resource described in the record. This may be used for the generation 
      of a display constant or for ordering multiple 856 fields. For further information, 
      see <a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/marbi/1997/97-01.html">Proposal No. 
      97-1</a> (Definition of Second Indicator (Relationship to Source) in Field 
      856 of the MARC Formats). Suggested display constants for the indicator 
      values are:

    <p> <strong>Subfield $3 (Materials specified).</strong> Subfield $3 is used 
      to specify to what portion or aspect of the resource the electronic location 
      and access information applies. Specific situations may be:<br>
      <br>
    <ul>
      <li>A portion or subset of the item is electronic<b><br>
        <br>
        Example</b>: $3table of contents; $3v. 2-5; $3abstract; $3b&w copy negative<br>
        <br>
      <li>A related electronic resource is being linked to the record<br>
        <br>
        <b> Example</b>: $3author's self- portrait 
    </ul>
    <p> <strong><br>
      Subfield $q (Electronic format type).</strong> Subfield $q was originally 
      defined as File transfer mode to include "binary" or "ascii". It was redefined 
      in June 1997 as Electronic format type to accommodate an Internet Media 
      Type (MIME type), such as text/html. Alternatively, textual information 
      about the electronic format type may also be recorded. See under &quot;<a href="856guide.html#lc_usage">LC 
      Usage</a>&quot; for a description on how LC has used subfield $q in the 
      <a href="http://memory.loc.gov/">American Memory</a> project. 
    <p> <b><a name="subfield_$u">Subfield $u (URI) repeatability.</a></b> Subfield 
      $u may be repeated only if both a URN and a URL or more than one URN are 
      recorded. Field 856 is repeated if more than one URL needs to be recorded. 
      Some institutions may wish to record a persistent name (URN) as well as 
      a resolvable HTTP URL in field 856. 
    <p> <b>Example:</b> 856 7#$dsawmp$f1694$u<a href="http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mbrsmi/sawmp.1694">http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mbrsmi/sawmp.1694</a>$uurn:hdl:loc.mbrsmi/sawmp.1694$2http<br>
    <p> <br>
      Persistent Uniform Resource Locators (<a href="http://purl.oclc.org/">PURLs</a>) 
      at OCLC are intended to deal with the problem of changeable URLs. Functionally, 
      a PURL is a URL, but it is intended to point to an intermediate resolution 
      service. Its persistence depends upon the updating of a PURL database when 
      the location of the resource changes. When recorded in field 856, it is 
      intended to allow for persistence so that each record containing the URL 
      need not be updated when the location changes. Since the PURL is supposed 
      to provide persistent access to the resource, it can be argued that there 
      is no reason to retain a URL that might become invalid. However, this is 
      an internal decision, and institutions that use PURLs should use subfield 
      $x (Nonpublic note) for the original URL if they wish to retain it. This 
      is an appropriate subfield, since it may not be desirable to display the 
      URL to the public because it could cause confusion. The <a href="http://www.loc.gov/acq/conser/purl/faq.htm#2us">CONSER 
      program</a> has, however, repeated subfield $u to include both the PURL 
      and cooresponding URL in the past.
    <p> <b>Subfield $y (Link Text).</b> Subfield $y contains link text which is 
      used for display in place of the URL in subfield $u. Often URLs are difficult 
      to read and most systems do not display them to the user. Since subfield 
      $y was not approved until June 2000 (see<a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/marbi/2000/2000-07.html"> 
      Proposal 2000-07</a>), there have been various practices in terms of systems 
      using data in the field as link text. Some systems have used subfields $3 
      or $z in the past for this purpose. It is not clear how widespread the use 
      of subfield $y is since its approval. 
    <p><strong>Subfield $z (Public Note).</strong> Subfield $z may be used for 
      any additional notes about the electronic resource at the specified location. 
      Examples include subscription information or access restrictions. 
    <p> <b>Example</b>: $zInclude desired file format following the hyphen in 
      the filename: EID0ASCII, EID-PDF or EID-PS. 
    <p> Institutions have used subfield $z in various ways. Some have created 
      a note for display repeating the URL in subfield $u. It would be preferable 
      for systems to display subfield $u rather than have those preparing records 
      to include information redundantly.

    <h3><a name="other_fields">URIs in Other Fields and Formats</a></h3>
    <p> <b>URLs in fields other than field 856.</b> Several proposals resulted

    <p> As with field 856, subfield $u should be repeated only when both a URL 
      and URN is recorded. 
    <p> 
    <p><b><a name="other_formats">Field 856 in other formats.</a></b> Field 856 
      is also defined in the authority, classification, and community information 
      formats. It may be used as follows:<br>
      <br>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Authority format:</b> Field 856 was defined in June 1998. Guidelines 
        will be needed from policy making bodies to further describe its use, 
        especially in cooperative projects. The intent of <a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/marbi/1998/98-13.html">Proposal 
        No. 98-13 </a> ( Define Field 856 in the MARC 21 Authorities Format) was 
        to provide electronic access to Web sites for organizations and other 
        supplementary information within an authority record.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Example: </b>856<b> </b>4#$3image$u<a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/wm/paint/auth/vinci/joconde/joconde.jpg">http://sunsite.unc.edu/wm/paint/auth/vinci/joconde/joconde.jpg</a><br>
        <br>
      <li><b>Classification format:</b> Field 856 provides a link from a MARC 
        classification record to a related electronic resource. This allows for 
        accessing visual aids from an online database of MARC classification records.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Example:</b> 856<b> </b>7#$uhttp://minaret.loc.gov/images/gschedule/G1350a.gif$yMap 
        of West south central states<br>
        <br>
      <li><b>Community Information format:</b> Field 856 provides a link from 
        a MARC community information record to community information available 
        on the Web, e.g., Web pages for organizations, events, services, etc. 
        <br>
        <b><br>
        Example:</b> 856 40$u<a href="../loc/events/index.php.html#15">http://www.loc.gov/loc/events/#15</a>$ySouthwest 
        Chamber Music in Concert<br>
        <br>
    </ul>
    <p> 
    <hr>
    <h3><a name="lc_usage">LC Usage</a></h3>
    Field 856 has been used at the Library of Congress as follows. <br>
    <br>
    Records for resources that have been digitized (or otherwise made available 
    electronically) as part of the National Digital Library Program (<a href="http://memory.loc.gov/">American 
    Memory</a>) may contain field 856. Generally, the field is added to the record 
    for the original item, rather than a new record created (unless it consists 
    of components that have been gathered together and only exist as an entity 
    in electronic form). In some cases, LC has also recorded a handle, which is 
    a URN. Older records may contain a URN in subfield $g (which is now obsolete). 
    <p> LC uses local codes in subfield $q to indicate the different categories 
      of a complex object. This is because digital reproductions created by the 
      Library of Congress are not single files and thus, Internet media types 
      recorded in subfield $q are not applicable. For example, the reproduction 
      of a book usually combines page images and text marked up in SGML. See <a href="http://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/856q.html">www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/856q.html</a> 
      for a complete list of local codes used in subfield $q.

    <h3><a name="changes">Major Changes Included</a></h3>
    The following are major changes made to the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/856guide_august1999.html">August
     1999</a> revision to create these (March 2003 revision) guidelines. <br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Added a table of contents, along with making other structural changes 
        to enhance the document's readability.<br>
        <br>
      <li>Updated the element list to include the changes made to the repeatability 
        of subfield $u. Subfield $g was also deleted because it was made obsolete 
        in 2000 (see <a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/marbi/2000/2000-02.html">Proposal 
        2000-02</a> for more information).<br>
        <br>
      <li>Added and revised the repeatability guidelines for field 856 and subfield 
        $u.<br>
        <br>
      <li>Updated the &quot;Encoding non-MARC characters&quot; section to include 
        implementation information for the spacing underscore and the spacing 
        tilde.<br>
        <br>
      <li>Added descriptions of subfields $q and $y to the &quot;Specific Data 
        Elements&quot; section. <br>
        <br>
      <li>Expanded the &quot;URLs in fields other than field 856&quot; section 
        to include a complete list of bibliographic and authority fields that 
        include subfield $u.<br>
        <br>
      <li>Expanded and added examples to the &quot;Field 856 in other formats&quot; 
        section. <br>
        <br>
      <li>Expanded the &quot;LC Usage&quot; section to include updated information 
        about how the Library of Congress uses field 856 in various projects.<br>
        <br>
      <li>Deleted the "Attachment B: Subfield Use When Not Using $u (URL)" section.<br>
        <br>
      <li>Updated the examples in the &quot;Examples&quot; section to match current 
        usage of field 856.
