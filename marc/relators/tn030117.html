<h1 align=center>TECHNICAL NOTICE (January 17, 2003)</h1>
<h2 align=center>Additions to the MARC Code Lists for Relators, Sources,
Description Conventions</h2>
<h3 align=center>Network Development and MARC Standards Office <br>Library of
Congress</h3>
<hr>
<p>The codes listed below have been recently approved for use in MARC 21 records. They
include 1 classification scheme source code, 3 subject source codes, and 1 source code for the
preferred citation of described materials. These new codes will be added to the online
<i>MARC Codes Lists for Relators, Sources, Description Conventions</i>.  The codes
should not be used in exchange records until after March 10, 2003.  This 60-day waiting period
is required to provide MARC 21 implementers with time to include newly defined codes in any
validation tables they may apply to the MARC fields
where these codes are used.</p>

<p>In addition to new codes, definitions were added to 22 existing
relator codes, which were previously listed without explanatory
text.  These definitions were added to facilitate their use
by other communities.</p>
