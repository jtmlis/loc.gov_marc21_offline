<h1>TECHNICAL NOTICE (February 18, 2009)</h1>

<h2>Additions to the MARC Code Lists for Relators, Sources,
Description Conventions</h2>

<p class="ndmsobyline">Network Development and MARC Standards Office <br>

<hr>
<p>The codes listed below have been recently approved for use in
MARC 21 records. The codes will be added to MARC Code List for

the areas of stage performance, archeology, and data and grant
administration.</p>

<p>The codes should not be used in exchange records until after
April 18, 2009. This 60-day waiting period is required to provide
MARC 21 implementers time to include newly defined codes in any
validation tables they may apply to the MARC fields where the
codes are used.</p>

<h4>MARC Relator Codes/Terms</h4>
