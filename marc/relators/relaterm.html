<h3>Arrangement of the List</h3>
<p>In the Term Sequence, the relator terms are listed alphabetically. A listing  by code is provided in a separate <a href="relacode.html">Code Sequence</a> list.  An entry for a term to which a code has been assigned includes the term  followed by the code in brackets, both in boldface. In many cases, a definition  follows the relator term. Any variants of the term are also listed. The first  type of variant term is preceded by the symbol UF (&ldquo;used for&rdquo;). For example:</p>
<!-- <dl id="beginList"> -->
<dl>
  <dt><span class="authorized">Expert</span><span class="relator-code"> [exp]</span></dt>
  <dd class="use-note">Use for a person  or organization in charge of the
    description and appraisal of the value of goods, particularly 
    rare items, works of art, etc.
    <div class="use-for-term"> <span class="use-for-label">UF</span> <span class="use-for-ref">Appraiser</span></div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p>The UF terms are included in the list as references, but are not in boldface.   The entry under the term referred to must be consulted to determine the code.   For example:</p>
<!-- <dl id="beginList"> -->
<dl>
  <dt class="unauthorized">Appraiser</dt>
  <dd>
    <div class="use-term"><span class="use-label">USE</span> <span class="use-ref">Expert</span></div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p>Entries may also include a note in [brackets] explaining a change in the use   of codes. For example:</p>
<!-- <dl id="beginList"> -->
<!-- <dl id="beginList"> -->

  <dt class="unauthorized">Graphic technician</dt>
