<hr>
<p>The relator codes listed below have recently been approved for use in MARC
21 records.  The new codes will be added to the online <em>MARC Codes Lists for Relators, Sources, 
Description Conventions</em>. The codes should not be used in exchange records until after August 29, 2004. This
60-day waiting period is required to provide MARC 21 implementers with time to include newly defined
codes in any validation tables they may apply to the MARC fields
where these codes are used.</p>
