<h2 align=center>MARC and the Year 2000</h2>
<h3 align=center>March 1998</h3>
<h3 align=center>Network Development and MARC Standards Office<br>Library of Congress</h3>
<hr>
<p>
This document indicates data elements in the MARC formats that contain dates that could be affected
by the century change in the year 2000.  Formats containing the data element are indicated as
follows:<br>
<ul><li>BD: USMARC Format for Bibliographic Data<br>
<li>AD: USMARC Format for Authority Data<br>
<li>CD: USMARC Format for Classification Data<br>
<li>CI: USMARC Format for Community Information<br>
<li>HD: USMARC Format for Holdings Data</ul>
If the data element occurs in all formats, none is specified.  The following abbreviations
are used to indicate date patterns:  <em>y</em>=year digit; <em>m</em>=month digit;
<em>d</em>=day digit.<br>
<p>
<strong>FORMATTED DATES WITH 2-DIGIT YEARS</strong><br>
<ul><li><strong>Library of Congress Control Numbers (Field 001 and 010)</strong><br>
Library of Congress control numbers (LCCNs) use the last
2 digits of the year as part of the number. This is a unique number that LC uses internally and
includes on records distributed by LC in field 001 and in field 010.  In the year 2000 the LCCN year
digits will be expanded to 4.<br>
A document, <em><a href="lccn.html">Library of Congress Control
Number
(LCCN)--Restructuring to accommodate century change</a></em>, issued in April 1997, details
LC's plans. 
<li><strong>Date entered on file (Field 008/00-05)</strong><br>
This field contains 6 digits that specify the date the record was first entered into
machine-readable form.  The date is given in the pattern <em>yymmdd</em>.  Since MARC
records were first created in 1968, no record can contain a year previous to that in this field. 
Therefore the 2-digit date will not become ambiguous until 2068. The date will remain 2-digit.
<li><strong>Intent to cancel date (Field 008/08-11)</strong> (HD)<br>
This date contains 4 digits that indicate an intent to cancel, the effective date of a
cancellation, or the date of the last expected part for a multipart or serial item. The date is given in
the pattern <em>yymm</em>.  Since MARC holdings records could not have been created before
1968, no record can contain a year previous to that in this
field.  Therefore the 2-digit date will not become ambiguous until 2068. The date will remain
2-digit.<br>
<li><strong>Date of report (Field 008/26-31)</strong> (HD)<br>
This date contains 6 digits that indicate the currency of the holdings information.  The
date is given in the pattern <em>yymmdd</em>. 
Since MARC holdings records could not have been created before 1968, no record can
contain a year previous to that in this field.  Therefore the 2-digit date will not become ambiguous
until 2068. The date will remain 2-digit.
<li><strong>Projected Publication Date (Field 263): $a(Projected publication date)</strong>
(BD)<br>
This date contains 4 digits that indicate the projected date of publication for works
that have not yet been published.  It is given in the pattern <em>yymm</em>.  Since MARC
records were first created in 1968, no record can contain a year previous to that in this field.
Therefore the 2-digit date will not become ambiguous until 2068. The date will remain
2-digit.</ul>
<p>
Note that the year 1968 has been used as the earliest possible date for the creation of MARC records.
However, in some cases, the earliest possible date may be later, since some formats were not
developed before the 1970s or 1980s (e.g., holdings).
<p>
Systems that use <em>yy</em> dates for sequencing operations will have to take into account
that these dates will not be changed with the year 2000 (i.e., 00 will follow 99). 
</ul>
<p>
<p>
<strong>FORMATTED DATES WITH 4-DIGIT YEARS</strong><br>
The following formatted dates may appear in MARC records, but the format specifies that they be
expressed with 4-digit years, thus they are all year-2000 compliant.<br>
<ul><li><strong>Field 004 (Coded Dates Fixed Field)</strong> (CI)<br>
Field 004 in Community Information contains coded date information.  The date is specified as 4
digits in the pattern <em>yyyy</em>.  This field will be made obsolete in 1998 in favor of field
046,
which will also specify 4 digits for these years.<br>
<li><strong>Field 005 (Date and Time of Latest Transaction)</strong><br>
Field 005 contains 16 digits that indicate the date and time of the latest transaction and
serves as a version identifier for the record.  The data is recorded according to
<em>Representation for Calendar Date and Ordinal Date for Information Interchange</em>
(ANSI X3.30).   The date is specified as 8 digits in the pattern <em>yyyymmdd</em>.
<li><strong>Field 007/17-22--Motion pictures (Film inspection date)</strong> (BD)<br>
These field 007 positions indicate the most recent film inspection date.  The date is specified as 6
digits in the pattern <em>yyyymm</em>.
<li><strong>Field 008/07-14 (Date of publication)</strong> (BD)<br>
Field 008/07-10 positions contains the beginning date of publication and field 008/11-14 contains the
ending date of publication (if applicable).  The year dates in these positions are specified as 4
digits in the pattern <em>yyyy</em>.
<li><strong>Field 013 (Patent Control Information): $d (Date)</strong> (BD)<br>
Field 013 contains in subfield $d the date that a patent or certificate was granted or the date of
acceptance of an application.  The date is specified as 8 digits in the pattern
<em>yyyymmdd</em>.<br>
<li><strong>Field 033 (Date/Time and Place of an Event): $a (Formatted date/time)</strong>
(BD)<br>
Field 033 contains in subfield $a the formatted date/time and/or coded place of creation, capture, or
broadcast associated with an event. The date is specified as 8 digits in the pattern
<em>yyyymmdd</em><br>
<li><strong>Field 045 (Time Period of Content): $b (Formatted 9999 B.C. through A.D. time
period) </strong> (AD, BD, CI)<br>
Field 045 may contain a time period in subfield $b preceded by a code for the era (<em>c</em>
 for B.C., <em>d</em> for A.D.).  The date is specified as 10 digits in the pattern
<em>yyyymmddhh</em>.
<li><strong>Field 046 (Type of Date Code, Date 1, Date 2 (B.C. Dates)): $b (Date 1 (B.C.
date), $c (Date 1 (A.D. date)), $d (Date 2 (B.C. date)), $e (Date 2 (A.D. date))</strong> 
(BD)<br>
Field 046 contains in subfields $b, $c, $d, and $e date of item information when it cannot be
recorded in the Fixed Length Data Elements (008/06-14).  The data in this field is not fixed length,
but full year is specified.  Community Information Format field 004 dates are being added to this
field, which is to be renamed Special Coded Dates.<br>
<li><strong>Field 355 (Security Classification Control): $g (Downgrading date), $h
(Declassification date)</strong> (BD)<br>
Field 355 contains in subfield $g the date of downgrading and in subfield $h the date of
declassification.  There is no standard specified, although examples record it in the form
<em>yymmdd</em> or <em>yyyymmdd</em>.  Since MARC records were first created in
1968, no record can contain a year previous to that in this field. Therefore the 2-digit date 
will not become ambiguous until 2068. The format will specify 4-digit dates in all examples in the
future.<br>
<li><strong>Field 533 (Reproduction note): $7/01-04 (Date 1), $7/05-08 (Date 2)</strong>
(BD)<br>

(Local implementation date) </strong> (CD)<br>

specified for recording the date, the date is given by example in the pattern
<em>yyyymmdd</em>.<br>
<li><strong>Field 843 (Reproduction Note): $7/01-04 (Date 1), $7/05-08 (Date 2)</strong>
(HD)<br>

in the pattern <em>yyyymmdd.</em><br></ul>
<p>
<strong>TEXTUAL DATES</strong><br>

representation of the date in those fields is specified by the input rules used.  Following are fields that
usually include textual dates, although a date may also be part of data in many other fields.
