<div id="introduction">
<p>The revision in 1997 of the definition for code
&ldquo;m&rdquo; (<span class="term">Computer file</span>) in
Leader/06 (<span class="term">Type of record</span>), that
narrowed its use to a computer file content orientation, as well
as the proliferation of electronic resources has prompted users
to request additional guidance when coding these materials. This
document presents some guidelines for coding Leader/06 in
bibliographic records for electronic resources and includes
examples with coding. Please note that this document discusses
content designation (MARC coding and tagging); it is not a guide
to cataloging rules and conventions used to create the content of
bibliographic records for electronic resources.</p>

<p>The list of <a href="ldr06guide.html#examples">examples</a> in this document
is an ongoing work in progress. Users who encounter types of
electronic resources not included in the list are encouraged to
bring them to the attention of the Network Development and MARC
Standards Office at the Library of Congress (<a href="http://www.loc.gov/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ff919b928c90bf93909cd1989089"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="6d0309001e022d01020e430a021b">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>).</p>

<h2><a id="ldr06">Principles and Guidelines for Coding
Leader/06</a></h2>

<p>An electronic resource is a manifestation of a work that
requires the use of a computer for access. Peripheral devices
attached to the computer (such as a CD-ROM drive) may also be
required. The manifestation's carrier is accessed either directly
(e.g., via CD-ROM, etc.) or remotely (e.g., via the Internet).
Items that do not require the use of a computer, such as audio
CDs or movies on DVD-videodiscs, are excluded from this
definition.</p>

<p>The <a href=
"http://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/ecbdldrd.html#mrcblea">Leader/06</a> <span class=
"term">(Type of record)</span> character position in the
<cite>MARC 21 Format for Bibliographic Data</cite> contains a
one-character alphabetic code that differentiates MARC records
created for various types of content and materials. The
definition of code &ldquo;m&rdquo; (computer file) in Leader/06
was revised in June 1997 as a result of <a href=
"http://www.loc.gov/marc/marbi/1997/97-03R.html"><cite>Proposal
No. 97-3R</cite></a>. The new definition narrowed the choice of
code &ldquo;m&rdquo; to the following types of electronic
resources:</p>

<ul>
<li>computer software (including programs, games, fonts)</li>
<li>numeric data</li>
<li>computer-oriented multimedia</li>
<li>online systems or services</li>
</ul>

<p>Code &ldquo;m&rdquo; is defined as follows in the <cite>MARC
21 Format for Bibliographic Data</cite>:</p>

<dl>
<dt>m - Computer file</dt>
<dd>Code m indicates that the content of the record is for the
following classes of electronic resources: computer software
(including programs, games, fonts), numeric data,
computer-oriented multimedia, online systems or services. For
these classes of materials, if there is a significant aspect that
causes it to fall into another Leader/06 category, code for that
significant aspect (e.g., vector data that is cartographic is not
coded as numeric but as cartographic). Other classes of
electronic resources are coded for their most significant aspect
(e.g. language material, graphic, cartographic material, sound,
music, moving image). In case of doubt or if the most significant
aspect cannot be determined, consider the item a computer
file.</dd>
</dl>

<p>This revised definition stipulates that catalogers code
electronic resources for the significant aspects of their
content, as opposed to their carrier.</p>

<p>The Leader/06 determines which 008 code (<span class=
"term">Fixed-length data elements - General information</span>)
is used and the appropriateness and validity of other fixed data
elements in a record.</p>
</div>

<hr />
<div id="fixed-field-coding-principles">
<h2><a id="fixed-fields">Principles and Guidelines for Coding
Fields 006, 007 and 008</a></h2>

<p>The 008 field contains character positions that provide coded
information about the record as a whole and about special
bibliographic aspects of the item cataloged. This field is not
repeatable. Field 006 (<span class="term">Fixed-length data
elements - Additional material characteristics</span>) permits
coding for additional aspects of an electronic resource
(including any computer file aspects) if the 007 and 008 fields
do not adequately describe it. Some cataloging utilities and
groups (such as CONSER) require the use of 006 fields under
certain conditions. Sample records in this document include 006
fields for those who may wish to use this field.</p>

<p>Coding all of these positions involves making a series of
decisions. Consider the following when deciding what code values
to select:</p>

<ul>
<li>What are the primary characteristics of the content of the
resource (as opposed to the physical format or carrier)? Look at
the definitions of the various Leader/06 codes. Is the content
primarily language material, notated music, cartographic
material, a computer file, a musical sound recording, etc.?</li>

<li>Does the resource match the Leader/06 definition of a
computer file? If so, &ldquo;m&rdquo; (for computer file) goes in
Leader/06, and the 008 field is coded for computer files.
Position 008/26 contains the code for the type of computer file
described in the record.</li>

<li>If Leader/06 is coded &ldquo;a&rdquo; (<span class=
"term">language material</span>), is the resource a monograph or
a continuing resource? This determines the code in Leader/07
(<span class="term">Bibliographic level</span>), which in turn
influences 008 field coding (<span class="term">Books</span> or
<span class="term">Continuing resources</span>). For other
material types, the Leader/06 code determines 008 coding.</li>

<li>Does the cataloger wish to add a 006 field to record
characteristics that cannot be coded in the 008 field? Some
electronic resources might need more than one 006 field. For
others, a 006 field may not really add any additional information
and could be left out.</li>

<li>Note that <a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/marbi/1997/97-03R.html"><cite>Proposal No.
97-3R</cite></a> specifies that a 007 field (<span class=
"term">Physical description fixed field</span>) for electronic
resources is mandatory regardless of the Leader/06 code value
when the physical form of the resource is an electronic format in
order to provide an explicit indication that the item is in an
electronic format.</li>

<li>Some combinations of 006, 007, and 008 fields may result in a
certain amount of redundancy, in the sense that the same
information about an electronic resource might appear in more
than one of these fields. Catalogers must decide whether the
information added as a result of recording additional
characteristics of an item justifies the redundancy.</li>
</ul>

<p>In case of doubt, or if the most significant characteristic
cannot be determined, code the resource &ldquo;m&rdquo; in the
Leader/06 position.</p>

<li>Notes: 
<ol>
<li>The sample records are partial records.</li>
<li>Some of the records have a Leader/07 with a value of
&ldquo;i&rdquo; (for <span class="term">integrating
resource</span>). Bibliographic Level &ldquo;i&rdquo; for
integrating resources was fully implemented in June 2006.</li>
<li>Some of the 006 fields in the sample records do not
necessarily provide much additional information but were added
for illustrative purposes.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>

<h4><a id="bibdata">Bibliographic database on the
Internet</a></h4>

<p>The record describes collections of bibliographic records
retrieved via search software; the presence of such software does
not change the content of the resource and does not mean that
Leader/06 should be coded &ldquo;m.&rdquo; The resource is
primarily textual bibliographic data, so it is coded as <span
class="term">language material</span>. The type of computer file
(006/09) is <span class="term">bibliographic data</span>.</p>

<h3><a id="ldr06-definitions"></a>Leader/06 definitions</h3>

<p>The Leader/06 (Type of record) character position contains a
one-character alphabetic code that is used to differentiate MARC
records created for various types of content and material.</p>

<p>Computer files are identified by a distinctive <span class=
"term">Type of record code</span> only if they belong to certain
categories of electronic resources as specified below; in all
other cases the type of content characteristics described by
other codes take precedence over the computer file
characteristics of the item.</p>

<dl>
<dt>a - Language material</dt>

<dd>Code &ldquo;a&rdquo; indicates that the content of the record is
for non-manuscript language material. Code &ldquo;a&rdquo; is also
used for microforms and electronic resources that are basically
textual in nature, whether they are reproductions from print or
originally produced. Manuscript language material uses code
&ldquo;t&rdquo;.</dd>

<dt>c - Notated music</dt>

<dd>Code &ldquo;c&rdquo; indicates that the content of the record is
for printed, microform, or electronic notated music.</dd>

<dt>d - Manuscript notated music</dt>

<dd>Code &ldquo;d&rdquo; indicates that the content of the record is
for manuscript notated music or a microform of manuscript
music.</dd>

<dt>e - Cartographic material</dt>

<dd>Code &ldquo;e&rdquo; indicates that the content of the record is
for non-manuscript cartographic material or a microform of
non-manuscript cartographic material. This code is used for maps,
atlases, globes, digital maps, and other cartographic items.</dd>

<dt>f - Manuscript cartographic material</dt>

<dd>Code &ldquo;f&rdquo; indicates that the content of the record is
for manuscript cartographic material or a microform of manuscript
cartographic material.</dd>

<dt>g - Projected medium</dt>

<dd>Code &ldquo;g&rdquo; indicates that the content of the record is
for a motion picture, videorecording (including digital video),
filmstrip, slide, or transparency. All of these media are
intended for projection. Material specifically designed for
overhead projection is also included in this type of record
category.</dd>

<dt>i - Nonmusical sound recording</dt>

<dd>Code &ldquo;i&rdquo; indicates that the content of the record is
for a recording of nonmusical sounds (e.g., speech).</dd>

<dt>j - Musical sound recording</dt>

<dd>Code &ldquo;j&rdquo; indicates that the content of the record is
for a musical sound recording.</dd>

<dt>k - Two-dimensional nonprojectable graphic</dt>

<dd>Code &ldquo;k&rdquo; indicates that the content of the record is
for a two-dimensional nonprojectable graphic such as, activity
cards, charts, collages, computer graphics, digital pictures,
drawings, duplication masters, flash cards, paintings, photo CDs,
photonegatives, photoprints, pictures, postcards, posters,
prints, spirit masters, study prints, technical drawings,
transparency masters, and reproductions of any of these.</dd>

<dt>m - Computer file</dt>

<dd>Code &ldquo;m&rdquo; indicates that the content of the record is
for the following classes of electronic resources: computer
software (including programs, games, fonts), numeric data,
computer-oriented multimedia, online systems or services. For
these classes of materials, if there is a significant aspect that
causes it to fall into another Leader/06 category, code for that
significant aspect (e.g., vector data that is cartographic is not
coded as numeric but as cartographic). Other classes of
electronic resources are coded for their most significant aspect
(e.g. language material, graphic, cartographic material, sound,
music, moving image). In case of doubt or if the most significant
aspect cannot be determined, consider the item a computer
file.</dd>

<dt>o - Kit</dt>

<dd>Code &ldquo;o&rdquo; indicates that the content of the record is
for a mixture of various components issued as a unit and intended
primarily for instructional purposes. No one component is
identifiable as the predominant component of the item. Examples
are packages of assorted materials, such as a set of school
social studies curriculum material (books, workbooks, guides,
activities, etc.), or packages of educational test materials
(tests, answer sheets, scoring guides, score charts,
interpretative manuals, etc.).</dd>

<dt>p - Mixed materials</dt>

<dd>Code &ldquo;p&rdquo; indicates that there are significant
materials in two or more forms that are usually related by virtue
of their having been accumulated by or about a person or body.
The intended primary purpose is other than for instructional
purposes (i.e., other than the purpose of those materials coded
as &ldquo;o&rdquo; (Kit)). This category includes archival fonds and
manuscript collections of mixed forms of materials, such as text,
photographs, and sound recordings.</dd>

<dt>r - Three-dimensional artifact or naturally occurring
object</dt>

<dd>Code &ldquo;r&rdquo; indicates that the content of the record is
for a three-dimensional artifact or a naturally occurring object.
This includes man-made objects such as models, dioramas, games,
puzzles, simulations, sculptures and other three-dimensional art
works, exhibits, machines, clothing, toys, and stitchery. It also
includes naturally occurring objects such as, microscope
specimens (or representations of them) and other specimens
mounted for viewing.</dd>

<dt>t - Manuscript language material</dt>

<dd>Code &ldquo;a&rdquo; indicates that the content of the record is
for manuscript language material or a microform of manuscript
language material. This category is applied to items for language
material in handwriting, typescript, or computer printout
including printed materials completed by hand or by keyboard. At
the time it is created, this material is usually intended, either
implicitly or explicitly, to exist as a single instance. Examples
include marked or corrected galley and page proofs, manuscript
books, legal papers, and unpublished theses and
dissertations.</dd>

<h3><a id="pos00826-definitions"></a>Definitions of data elements
in 008/26 and 006/09 positions for Computer files</h3>

<dl>
<dt>008/26 - Type of computer file (006/09)</dt>

<dd>A one-character alphabetic code indicates the type of
electronic resource being described. The specific type of
electronic resource is also described in textual form in field
516 (<span class="term">Type of Computer File or Data
Note</span>). A fill character (|) is used when no attempt has
been made to code this 008 position.</dd>

<dt>a - Numeric data</dt>

<dd>Code &ldquo;a&rdquo; indicates an electronic resource that
contains mostly numbers or representation by numbers, such as
records containing all information on student test scores, all
information on football team statistics, etc. The information may
be original surveys and/or information that has been summarized
or statistically manipulated.</dd>

<dt>b - Computer program</dt>

<dd>Code &ldquo;b&rdquo; indicates an electronic resource containing
an ordered set of instructions directing the computer to perform
basic operations and identifying the information and mechanisms
required. This category includes videogames and microcomputer
software and computer models. Some types of computer programs
(e.g., game, font) are identified by separate codes in this
character position.</dd>

<dt>c - Representational</dt>

<dd>Code &ldquo;c&rdquo; indicates an electronic resource that
contains pictorial graphic data that can be manipulated in
conjunction with other types of files to produce graphic patterns
that can be used to interpret and give meaning to the
information. It does not include a document in image format.</dd>

<dt>d - Document</dt>

<dd>Code &ldquo;d&rdquo; indicates an electronic resource that is
textual, consisting mostly of alphabetic information (words or
sentences) converted into a coded format that can be processed,
sorted, and manipulated by machine, and then retrieved in many
optional formats. It includes language material intended to
constitute a textual document, whether represented as ASCII or
image data. It includes both single bibliographic entities or a
collection of bibliographic entities. Documents whose primary
purpose is textual, even if search software is present, are coded
here.</dd>

<dt>e - Bibliographic data</dt>

<dd>Code &ldquo;e&rdquo; indicates that an electronic resource
consists of data with bibliographic citations. This includes data
from library catalogs or citation databases. The data may be in a
structured or unstructured form. Search software may be present,
but the purpose of the record is description of the content of
the bibliographic data or database, rather than description of
the online system or service.</dd>

<dt>f - Font</dt>

<dd>Code &ldquo;f&rdquo; indicates that an electronic resource
contains information for a computer to produce fonts.</dd>

<dt>g - Game</dt>

<dd>Code &ldquo;g&rdquo; indicates that an electronic resource is a
game, intended for recreational or educational use. Generally
games consist of text and software. A videogame is included
here.</dd>

<dt>h - Sounds</dt>

<dd>Code &ldquo;h&rdquo; indicates that the file consists of data
encoding sounds producible by the computer.</dd>

<dt>i - Interactive multimedia</dt>

<dd>Code &ldquo;i&rdquo; indicates that the electronic resource
described by the record supports navigation through and
manipulation of many kinds of media (i.e., audio, video, etc.).
Interactive multimedia usually gives the user a high level of
control, often allowing almost conversational interaction with
the computer and data.</dd>

<dt>j - Online system or service</dt>

<dd>Code &ldquo;j&rdquo; indicates that the record is for an online
system or service and may contain nonbibliographic information.
An online system or service supports system-based user
interaction. If the focus of the record is to describe the system
itself, with the content of the databases incidental contained
therein, it is coded here. If the resource is an online file
where the system is incidental to the description, it falls into
another category. Examples of online systems or services are:
online library systems (consisting of a variety of databases),
FTP sites, electronic bulletin boards, network information
centers.</dd>

<dt>m - Combination</dt>

<dd>Code &ldquo;m&rdquo; is used when the item is a combination of two
or more of the above types of files.</dd>

<dt>u - Unknown</dt>

<dd>Code &ldquo;u&rdquo; indicates that the type of file is
unknown.</dd>

<dt>z - Other</dt>

<dd>Code &ldquo;z&rdquo; indicates a type of file for which none of
the other defined codes are appropriate.</dd>
