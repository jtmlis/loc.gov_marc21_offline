        <hr>
        <p> The LC control numbering system has had the same basic structure since 
          its initial use to control Library of Congress bibliographic information 
          in card form beginning in 1898 (LCCN structure A). On January 1, 2001, 
          a structural change will occur (LCCN structure B). The basic control 
          number has been fixed in length at 12 characters and will remain that 
          length, although under LCCN structure A suffixes were occasionally used 
          and under LCCN structure B the location of element parts is slightly 
          altered to accommodate a four digit year. Under both structures, the 
          prefix, year, and serial number are the basic elements required to make 
          a LCCN unique.

        Prefixes are carried in a MARC record as lowercase alphabetic characters 
        and serve to differentiate between different series of LC control numbers. 
        Prefixes are left justified and unused positions contain blanks. If no 
        prefix is present, the prefix portion contains blanks. 
        <p> <strong>Authority Record Prefixes</strong>
        <p> The following alphabetic prefixes have been established by the Library 
          of Congress for Authority records. They are used in both LCCN Structures 
          A and B.

        <p> <b><a name="struca_prefix">Bibliographic Record Prefixes [Structure 
          A Only]</a></b> 
        <p> The following alphabetic prefixes were formally used by the Library 
          of Congress for Bibliographic records. Since they were used in records 
          before 2001, they are found in LCCN Structure A only. 
        <P> Prior to the existence of MARC records, prefixes of various lengths 
          were used on printed cards with combinations of uppercase or lowercase 
          letters and numbers. For MARC records, equivalents have been defined 
          by the Library of Congress for some of these early prefixes. The second 
          column in the list below gives prefixes found on printed cards not printed 
          from machine-readable records and shows how they are to be input into 
          a MARC version of the record. Only card prefixes which have a MARC form 
          noted below should be recorded in machine-readable records.

        <strong>Authority Records</strong><br>
        For control numbers assigned under LCCN structure A, the year portion 
        consists of two digits representing the year the control number was assigned. 
        In name authority records that were converted retrospectively by an agency 
        under contract to LC, the digits 50 were used for the year for name authority 
        records, and the digits 42 were used for series authority records. In 
        subject authority records that were converted retrospectively from an 
        LC internal format to MARC, the digits 85 were used instead of the actual 
        year of creation. 
        <p> For control numbers assigned under the LCCN structure B beginning 
          with the year 2001, the year portion consists of four digits. 
        <p> <strong>Bibliographic Records</strong><br>
          For control numbers assigned under LCCN structure A, the year portion 
          consists of two digits representing the year the control number was 
          assigned. In most numbers, the year portion reflects the year in which 
          the LC control number was assigned to the record for the bibliographic 
          item. During the 1969-1972 period, a <i>7-series</i> year number was 
          assigned. In these numbers the initial digit of 7 was followed by a 
          modulus-ll check digit. The year in which the card number was assigned 
          can be approximated from the year portion of the Date entered on file 
          (008/00-05). With the re-institution of the year series number in 1972, 
          provisions were made to skip those individual card numbers which could 
          have been assigned previously as a 7-series number. <i>Note</i>: 7-series 
          numbers were not used for non-book map material. The prefix <i>gm</i> 
          was used from 1968 through 1972. 
        <p> For control numbers assigned under the LCCN structure B beginning 
          with the year 2001, the year portion consists of four digits. 
        <p> For LC control numbers with two-digit years, the century may be determined 
          according to the following table:

          For control numbers assigned under LCCN structure A, the year portion 
          consists of two digits normally representing the year the record was

        The serial number portion consists of one to six digits. Serial numbers 
        of less than six digits are right justified and unused positions contain 
        zeros. The hyphen which separates the year and the serial number on LC 
        displays and printed products is not carried in the MARC record. For example, 
        the number 85-2 is carried as 85000002 in a record.

        This character position was originally defined to carry a supplement number 
        for dashed-on supplement entries in bibliographic records. Use of the 
        supplement number was not implemented for bibliographic, authority, classification, 
        holdings and community information records, therefore this position contains 
        a blank in all LCCN Structure A identifiers.

        <h3><a name="suffix">Suffix/Alphabetic Identifier (Bibliographic Records 
          only) [Structure A Only]</a></h3>
        Older LC control numbers sometimes include suffixes or alphabetic identifiers 
        carried as variable length data following the Supplement number. A single 
        slash (/) introduces the suffix/alphabetic identifier. Multiple occurrences 
        of either suffixes or alphabetic identifiers are separated one from the 
        other by a slash. Suffixes and alphabetic identifiers do not affect the 
        uniqueness of the control number. 
        <p> All suffixes and alphabetic identifiers, except the revision date, 
          appear in the MARC record as uppercase alphabetic characters. On printed 
          card copy, suffixes appear after the LC control number separated by 
          a slash. Suffixes have not been assigned since 1969 and they will be 
          deleted from Library of Congress files in 1999. Alphabetic identifiers 
          appear on printed card copy as uppercase alphabetic characters beneath 
          the LC card number in the lower right hand corner of the card. Alphabetic 
          identifiers were first assigned in 1969 and were used as distribution 
          information for card copy by LC. Alphabetic identifiers were deleted 
          from the Library of Congress files in 1999.

        <h3><a name="date">Revision Date (Bibliographic Records only) [Structure 
          A Only]</a> </h3>
        The revision date associated with LC control numbers specified the latest 
        date that the bibliographic data in a record underwent a change. Revision 
        data do not affect the uniqueness of the control number. To account for 
        the number of times significant changes have been made to a record beyond 
        the first such change, a number was added as the last character of the 
        revision date. The date a record was originally created is the Date entered 
        on file (field 008/00-05). 
        <p> A revision date such as <i>"r73"</i> means that the record was changed 
          in 1973. The revision date <i>"r743"</i> means that significant changes 
          have been made to the record three times, the last being made in 1974.

        The revision date was used as an indication of the degree of importance 
        of a change made to a record. A significant change to a record at the 
        Library of Congress was defined as one important enough to warrant, among 
        other things, redistribution of cards to LC's own catalogs. A significant 
        change included changes to content designation, to an access point (fields 
        020, $a or $z, 028, $a, 050, 051, 082, 1XX, 240, 245 #a, 4XX (excluding 
        490), 6XX, 7XX, 8XX), a change to the extent of an item (300 #a), a change 
        to the publication date (260 #c), a change to the record control number 
        (field 001), or a change to Leader/18 (Descriptive cataloging form). 
        <p> Revision information was separated from a suffix or an alphabetic 
          identifier by one slash (/). If no suffixes or alphabetic identifiers 
          are present, revision information was separated from the Supplement 
          number by two slashes (//). The inclusion of revision data was discontinued 
          in 1999 and deleted from all records in the Library of Congress files.
