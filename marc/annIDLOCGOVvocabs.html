<P>Announcement: New Vocabularies Added to LC Authorities  and Vocabularies Service

<p>The Library of Congress is pleased to make available new  vocabularies from its Authorities and Vocabularies web service (ID.LOC.GOV),  which provides access to Library of Congress authority and vocabulary data as  Linked Data.&nbsp; The new additions include:</p>
<p>MARC List for Countries<br>
  MARC List for Geographic Areas<br>
  MARC List for Languages</p>
<p>The MARC Countries entries include references to their  equivalent ISO 3166 codes.&nbsp; The MARC  Languages have been cross referenced with ISOs 639-1, 639-2, and 639-5, where  appropriate.&nbsp; Additional vocabularies  will be added in the future, including additional PREMIS controlled  vocabularies.</p>
<p>The vocabulary data are published in RDF using the  SKOS/RDF Vocabulary.&nbsp; Individual concepts  are accessible via the ID.LOC.GOV web service via a web browser interface or  programmatically via content-negotiation.&nbsp;  The vocabulary data are also available for bulk download.</p>
<p>As always, your feedback is important and welcomed.&nbsp; Though we are interested in all forms of  constructive commentary on all topics related to ID, we're particularly  interested in how the data available from ID.LOC.GOV is used.&nbsp; Your contributions directly inform service  enhancements.</p>
<p>The Authorities and Vocabularies web service was first  made available in May 2009 and offered the Library of Congress Subject Headings  (LCSH), the Library's initial entry into the Linked Data movement.&nbsp; In part by assigning each vocabulary and each  data value within it a unique resource identifier (URI), the service provides a  means for machines to semantically access, use, and harvest authority and  vocabulary data that adheres to W3C recommendations, such as Simple Knowledge  Organization System (SKOS).&nbsp; In this way,  the Authorities and Vocabularies web service also makes government data  publicly and freely available in the spirit of the Open Government  directive.&nbsp; Although the primary goal of  the service is to enable machine access to Library of Congress data, a web  interface serves human users searching and browsing the vocabularies.</p>
