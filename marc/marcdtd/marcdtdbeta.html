<h2 align=center>Announcement to Users of MARC and SGML</h2>
<hr>
<p>We are happy to announce the availability not only of the <i>beta</i>
test version of the MARC DTDs, but also new freeware utilities that
permit the conversion between the MARC and SGML structures.  The new
beta versions of the DTDs are intended to be used for field testing and
continued implementation of MARC in SGML (Standard Generalized
Markup Language) systems.  We are targeting this announcement to
subscribers to the MARC Electronic Forum since you represent those
most interested in the development and use of this
new implementation of SGML for MARC data.</p>

<p>SGML, as applied in this suite of DTD's and related files, makes
it possible to move MARC cataloging data into the SGML environments. 
Another goal of the MARC DTD project was to develop freeware
MARC-to-SGML and SGML-to-MARC conversion utilities
to facilitate this movement of data between the two data
structures.  This beta release includes those long-awaited utilities
which should facilitate advanced testing of the MARC DTDs.</p>

<h2>Conversion Utilities and Other Things New</h2>

<p>The development of the conversion utilities was a major effort and
led to a few changes in the MARC DTDs themselves.  It was decided
to write conversion software using PERL (
<i><b>P</b>ractical 
<b>E</b>xtraction and
<b>R</b>eport 
<b>L</b>anguage</i>) Version 5.  It was decided
to develop the utilities as PERL "scripts" since as an interpreted
programming language, it would not be necessary to recompile the
PERL scripts to run on different software platforms.  PERL
interpreters are available for a variety of platforms including DOS,
Windows, Windows NT, OS/2, Macintosh, and UNIX.  PERL interpreters
are also free, which means that potential users would not have
to buy anything to make use of the utilities.</p>

<p>Besides the availability of conversion software, MARC SGML
experimenters will also notice a change in the MARC DTDs themselves. 
The names of the DTDs are now "mrcafile.dtd" and "mrcbfile.dtd",
instead of "mrca.dtd" and "mrcb.dtd" as they were with the alpha test
versions.  The names were changed to reflect
the change in the scope of the DTDs.  They now support the creation
of multiple MARC records (that is, files of records) as a single
SGML instance.  The alpha test version forced each MARC record to be
handled as a separate SGML document, which did not prove to be an
effective use of SGML.  Since MARC records are rarely exchanged
individually, the handling of them in SGML as files of records
made sense and was incorporated into the beta version.</p>

<h2>What You Need To Do:</h2>

<p>To make use of the beta version of the MARC DTDs and the conversion
software, you will need various files and support documents.  They are
all available to you electronically via FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
from an anonymous file server maintained by the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.  The host domain (address) of LC's
FTP server is: <b>ftp.loc.gov</b></p>

<p>Once an FTP session is initiated, you will be prompted for a
name.  You should enter:
<ol>
<li>"<i>anonymous</i>"</li>

<li>When you are prompted for a password, enter your <i>Internet
address</i>, or simply your name.</li>

<li>At the FTP> prompt, change to the MARC DTD subdirectory by
entering the command: "<i>cd pub/marcdtd</i>"  NOTE: The character
between the subdirectory names is a forward slash!</li>

<li>Enter the command "<i>dir</i>", if needed, to see a list of the
files available in the MARC DTD subdirectory.
</ol>

<p>Files are actually transferred using the "<i>get</i>" command,
which is available with most FTP software.  The "<i>get</i>" command
will copy a file to the default directory on the machine you are
using locally.  Some of the files should be transferred as ASCII
text files.  ASCII mode is usually the default with FTP software.
To verify that you are in ASCII mode, enter the command "<i>asc</i>".
You FTP software should respond with the message "<i>Type is A</i>"
or some similar message which confirms you are set in the ASCII mode.
The other possible mode is the binary mode.  Entering "<i>bin</i>",
or "<i>binary</i>" will switch to binary mode.  <b>NOTE:</b> Failure
to use ASCII mode when transferring text files such as DTDs and PERL
scripts will corrupt them.</p>

<ul>FILES TRANSFERABLE AS ASCII TEXT:
<li>mrcsgml.dec</li>
<li>mrcafile.dtd</li>
<li>mrcbfile.dtd</li>
<li>*.ent  [Entity reference files, i.e., files with the
 extension ".ent"]</li>
</ul>

<p>To retrieve the numerous entity reference files, use the
command "<i>mget</i>" instead of "<i>get</i>".  You will be prompted as the
systems begins to transfer each entity reference file to you. 
Answer "<i>y</i>" (yes) to each prompt.</p>

<p>Because the MARC-to-SGML and SGML-to-MARC conversion utilities involve a
number of files, they have been compressed into a single file using
compression software called PKZIP (from PKWARE).  You will need to
use PKUNZIP to decompress the conversion utilities.  As compressed
files, they need to be transferred using the FTP "<i>binary</i>" mode.

<ul>FILES TRANSFERABLE IN BINARY MODE:
<li><a href="ftp://ftp.loc.gov/pub/marcdtd/marcconv.zip">marcconv.zip</a></li>
<li><a href="ftp://ftp.loc.gov/pub/marcdtd/pkunzip.exe">pkunzip.exe</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you do not have access to FTP, you may request a diskette
containing this file by contacting the Library of Congress, <a href=
"http://lcweb.loc.gov/marc/ndmso.html">Network Development and MARC
Standards Office (NDMSO)</a>, who will be acting as the maintenance
agency for these utilities. </p>

<p>We encourage you to experiment with the MARC DTDs. The
results of testing the beta version of the DTDs and the conversion utilities will allow us to
perfect them for future users.  If you know of anyone else interested
in this effort, encourage them to subscribe to the MARC electronic
forum by sending a subscription message to "<a href="http://lcweb.loc.gov/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="8ae6e3f9fef9eff8fccae6e5e9a4ede5fc">[email&#160;protected]</a>".</p>
