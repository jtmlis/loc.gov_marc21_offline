<h2>General Information</h2>

<h3 id="definition">What is MARC 21? What does the acronym
&ldquo;MARC&rdquo; mean?</h3>

<p>MARC is the acronym for MAchine-Readable Cataloging. It
defines a data format that emerged from a Library of Congress-led
initiative that began nearly forty years ago. It provides the mechanism
by which computers exchange, use, and interpret bibliographic
information, and its data elements make up the foundation of most
library catalogs used today. MARC became USMARC in the 1980s and
MARC 21 in the late 1990s.</p>

<h3 id="marc21vsuscan">How does MARC 21 differ from the USMARC
and CAN/MARC formats?</h3>

<p>MARC 21 is not a new format. After having discussions and
making minor changes to both formats that accommodated USMARC and
CAN/MARC users' specific needs, the USMARC and CAN/MARC (Canadian
MARC) formats were &ldquo;harmonized&rdquo; into MARC 21 in 1997. See <a
href="annmarc21.html">http://www.loc.gov/marc/annmarc21.html</a>
for more information about the harmonization.</p>

<h3 id="maintenance">Who maintains the MARC 21
formats?</h3>
<p>The Network Development and MARC Standards Office at the
Library of Congress and the Standards and the Support Office at
the Library and Archives Canada maintain the MARC 21 formats.
Input for development is provided by MARC 21 users from around
the world, including libraries, library networks and utilities,
and library system vendors. See <a href=
"overview.html">http://www.loc.gov/marc/overview.html</a> for
more information about the development and maintenance of the
formats.</p>

<h3 id="NDMSOdef">What are the Network Development and MARC
Standards Office and the Standards Division?</h3>
<p>The <a href="ndmso.html">Network Development and MARC
Standards Office</a> plans and develops library and information
network standards at the Library of Congress. It is the
maintenance agency for several national standards, including the
MARC 21 formats.To contact it, please e-mail <a href="http://www.loc.gov/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4b252f2638240b272428652c243d"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="3e505a534d517e52515d10595148">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/services/cataloguing-metadata/Pages/cataloguing-metadata.aspx">Standards
Division</a> at the Library and Archives Canada maintains and
supports the MARC 21 formats and other library standards. To
contact it, please e-mail <a href="http://www.loc.gov/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e6a4a7a5c8a889948b83958283858792878a8981878183cba58792878a8981938f8881959287888287948295c8aaa7a5a6858788878287c88587"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="3a787b7914745548575f495e5f595b4e5b56555d5b5d5f17795b4e5b56555d4f53545d494e5b545e5b485e4914767b797a595b545b5e5b14595b">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.</p>

<h3 id="listserv">Are there any discussion groups or forums
for the MARC 21 formats?</h3>
<p>The <a href="marcforum.html">MARC Forum</a> is a listserv
maintained by the Network Development and MARC Standards Office
and is open to anyone interested in the implementation,
maintenance and development of the MARC 21 formats. The forum
provides an opportunity for members of the information community
to participate in discussions related to the formats. Vendor,
network, technical service, automation, and reference staff and
researchers are encouraged to participate. While there is a close
linkage between MARC 21 and the cataloging of materials, the
focus of the forum is on the use of MARC 21 as a communications
format.</p>

<h2>MARC 21 Documentation</h2>
<h3 id="documentation">What documentation is available and
and how do I obtain it?</h3>
<p>The <a href="../marc.html">MARC Standards</a> page
has links to both extensive documentation on MARC 21, including both the full and concise formats, code and field lists, information about MARC 21
development, and documentation to help users with the MARC 21
format. There is a <a href="status.html">format overview</a> listing changes to MARC documentation. Some documentation is also available in <a href=
"translations.html">translation.</a>
A <a href="readings.html">bibliography</a> is also available
on the Library's MARC Standards webpage.</p>

<p>Documentation of French versions of some of the formats in Canada is available at  <a
href="http://www.marc21.ca/index-f.html">
Library and Archives Canada</a>.</p>

<h3 id="updates">How often is MARC 21 documentation
updated?</h3>
<p>The MARC 21 formats are updated two times per year, in the spring and fall. Other
documentation is updated as it becomes necessary.</p>

<h3 id="excerpts">May I use excerpts from MARC 21
documentation?</h3>
<p>Using excerpts is permissible as long as credit is given.</p>

<p class="gototop"><a href="faq.html#topofdocument">Back to Top</a></p>

<h2>MARC 21 Tutorials</h2>

<h3 id="tutorial">Is there a tutorial for the MARC 21
formats?</h3>
<p><a href="umb.html"><cite>Understanding MARC
Bibliographic</cite></a> is a good introduction to the MARC 21
bibliographic format and includes a bibliography, discussion
questions and examples. It is widely used and has been translated
into several different languages.</p> 

<p><a href="uma/index.html"><cite>Understanding MARC Authority
Records</cite></a> is a good introduction to the MARC 21
authority format and includes a bibliography, discussion
questions and examples.</p>

<cite>Understanding MARC Authority Records</cite> are also 
available as booklets from the <a href=
"../cds/index.html">Cataloging Distribution
Service</a>.</p>

<p class="gototop"><a href="faq.html#topofdocument">Back to Top</a></p>

<h2>MARC 21, SGML, XML and other metadata standards</h2>
<h3 id="sgmlxml">Are SGML or XML versions of the MARC 21
formats available?</h3>
<p>The Network Development and MARC Standards Office has
developed a framework for working with MARC data in a XML
environment. This framework is intended to be flexible and
extensible, allowing users to work with MARC data in ways that
meet their specific needs. The framework contains many components
such as schemas, stylesheets, and software tools developed and
maintained by the Library of Congress. Conversion utilities
between MARC (ISO 2709) and MARCXML are also available. Please
see <a href="marcxml.html">www.loc.gov/marc/marcxml.html</a>.</p>

<p>The Network Development and MARC Standards Office also
developed a MARC to SGML and SGML to MARC conversion program. The
following documents contain the program and additional
information:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="marcdtd/marcdtdback.html">MARC DTDs: Background and
Development</a></li>
<li><a href="marcdtd/marcdtdbeta.html">MARC DTDs: Beta Test

</ul>

<p>A list of some tools that work with HTML, SGML and XML
applications is at <a href=
"marctools.html">http://www.loc.gov/marc/marctools.html</a>.</p>

<h3 id="metadatamapping">Is MARC 21 mapped to other metadata
standards? Are other standards mapped to MARC 21?</h3>

<h2>MARC 21 Translations</h2>
<h3 id="translations">Are there any translations of the MARC
21 formats?</h3>
<p>The <a href="translations.html">MARC 21 Translations</a> page 
contains a list of documents that are 
either direct translations or close adaptations of the
MARC 21 formats and other MARC documentation. 
Where applicable, information regarding
differences between the translations and MARC 21 is provided. The
formats are listed alphabetically by the language of each
translation and include full bibliographic citations and contact
information.</p>

<h3 id="translationshowto">I would like to translate a MARC
21 publication. What should I do?</h3>
<p>Translations of the MARC 21 formats and other MARC documentation

<p>If you notice an error or omission in either the print or
online MARC 21 documentation, please contact <a href="http://www.loc.gov/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a7c9c3cad4c8e7cbc8c489c0c8d1"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="ea848e879985aa868589c48d859c">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>. Describe the error and
where it occurs. Please be as specific as possible.</p>

<h3 id="changes">How do I propose making a change to the
MARC 21 formats?</h3>
<p>Proposals for changes to the formats may originate from any
MARC 21 user. Please either fill out the <a href=
"chgform.html">MARC 21 Formats Proposed Change Form</a> or
contact the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#88e6ece5fbe7c8e4e7eba6efe7fe">Network Development
and MARC Standards Office</a> at the Library of Congress or the
<a href="http://www.loc.gov/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c5a8a4b7a685aba9a6e8a7aba6eba6a4">Standards division</a> at the
Library and Archives Canada. Maintenance agency staff at the
Library of Congress and the Library and Archives Canada write,
edit and review proposals and discussion papers twice a year and
distribute them via the <a href="marcforum.html">MARC Forum
listserv</a> and the MARC Standards web site. Discussions at the
semiannual <a href=
"marbi/marbi.html">MARBI
(Machine-Readable Bibliographic Information)</a> meetings in the
United States and the annual <a href=
"http://cfla-fcab.ca/en/about/committees/cms-committee/">CCM (Canadian
Committee on MARC)</a> meeting in Canada, along with suggestions
received by e-mail and the listserv, are used by the maintenance
agencies to make final decisions on the proposals.</p>

<h3 id="orgcodes">How do I request new or revised MARC 21
organization codes?</h3>
<p>Before requesting a MARC 21 organization code, please first
search the <a href="organizations/index.html"><em>MARC Code List for
Organizations</em></a>. If you do not find a code for your
organization, click on one of these links to access a request
form in the language of your choice.</p>
<div id="orgcodesforms">
<ul>
<li><a href="organizations/form-eng.html">[ENGLISH]</a></li>
<li><a href=
"organizations/form-spa.html">[ESPA&#x00D1;OL]</a></li>
<li><a href=
"organizations/form-por.html">[PORTUGU&#x00CA;S]</a></li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>You may use the online form to request up to three codes. If
more than three codes are needed, please submit a list of the
organizations with their names and addresses (including street,
city, state, postal code, and country) via email to <a href="http://www.loc.gov/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#026c666f716d426e6d612c656d74"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="b8d6dcd5cbd7f8d4d7db96dfd7ce">[email&#160;protected]</span></a> Please include contact
information. Note: Attachments to e-mail messages are not
accepted.</p>

<p>The <cite>MARC Code List for Organizations</cite> is updated
frequently, as codes are often added. Since information in a
request must be verified and then incorporated into the list,
there is a short delay between the time of the request and the
appearance of a newly-assigned code in the database. Names and
addresses are revised when changes are reported.</p>

<p>Requests for the assignment of new codes or changes involving
organizations in Canada should be sent to the <a href=

<h2>Record Requirements and Record and File Specifications for
MARC 21</h2>
<h3 id="requirements">Where do I find the U.S. National
Level/Minimal Level Record Requirements for the MARC 21
formats?</h3>
<p>There is no list of of &ldquo;mandatory&rdquo; data elements that must
appear in a MARC 21 record. Thereotically, a record could simply
consist of a leader and a 245 (title) field. However, there is a
list of the MARC 21 data elements required to meet minimal and
national level requirements in the United States for the <a href=
"bibliographic/nlr/index.html">bibliographic</a> and <a href=
"authority/nlr/nlr.html">authority</a> formats. Please note that
other countries may have different lists of required data
elements.</p>

<h3 id="specifications">What are the appropriate record and
file specifications for the formats?</h3>
<p>Information about the file specifications for the MARC 21
formats is in <a href="specifications.html"><cite>MARC 21
Specifications for Record Structure, Character Sets, and Exchange
Media</cite></a>. This document is also available from the <a href=
"../cds/index.html">Cataloging
Distribution Service</a>. For a basic introduction to MARC 21
file and record structure, you may also want to look at <a href=
"umb.html"><cite>Understanding MARC Bibliographic</cite></a>.</p>

<h3 id="charactersets">What are the specifications for
character sets?</h3>
<p>MARC 21 records intended for broad, standard interchange
should be encoded according to the following specifications.
Either an 8-bit based encoding system (called MARC-8 in MARC 21
documentation) or a variable 8/16-bit encoding following ISO/IEC
10646 (UCS) and Unicode UTF-8 encoding rules (called UCS/Unicode
UTF-8 in MARC 21 documentation) may be used.</p>

<p>A very large repertoire of characters is defined for use in
the MARC-8 environment. For standard MARC 21 interchange, the use
of UCS/Unicode UTF-8 is limited to this same repertoire, a subset
