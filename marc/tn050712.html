<h1 align="center">TECHNICAL NOTICE</h1>
<h2 align="center">Additions to the MARC Country and Geographic Area Code Lists</h2>
<h3 align="center">Network Development and MARC Standards Office</h3>

<hr>

<p>The codes listed below have been approved for use in MARC 21 records. They
  include MARC  country and geographic area codes for states and territories
  in Australia requested 
   by the National Library of Australia.</p>
   
<p>From 1972 until the adoption of USMARC as the national standard in 1991, Australia
  had its own  MARC specification, AUSMARC, that  included more 
  specific country codes for states and territories. The National Library
  of Australia has continued to use these more specific codes in its national
   bibliographic database for the ability to retrieve data by state and territory
  jurisdiction.</p>
  
 <p>Codes are available at this level for similar  jurisdictions in the United 
  States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.</p>
 
<!-- 
<p>In AUSMARC extensions to the country and geographic code were added for Australian
  states and  territories. These extensions were retained in Australian bibliographic
  records 
   and added to new records after the adoption of the USMARC specification. Australia's
  national bibliographic database  Kinetica contains nearly two million records;
   most of them contain the code extensions.</p>

<p>Australia has a federal system of government. State jurisdictions provide
  services  including health and education. Australian libraries need the ability
  to retrieve bibliographic 
  data based on these jurisdictions. Codes of this type are already available
  for similar  jurisdictions in the United 
  States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The standardization of these extensions
  for first-level political jurisdictions will prove beneficial. It will be easier
  for Australian libraries to maintain this data and the greater level of specificity
  will enhance 
  retrieval of bibliographic data for all libraries.</p> -->
  
<p>The following new codes are defined for Australian states and territories and will be included 
   in the next edition of the <em>MARC Code List for Countries</em>.</p>
