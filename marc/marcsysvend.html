<dt><a href="https://accessitlibrary.com/">Accessit Library</a></dt>
<dd>Accessit is a library management system designed to support an entire school or organization, streamlining workflows to help build a connected community of learners. For librarians, it’s a powerful, yet easy-to-use solution that automates day-to-day tasks and puts the library at the heart of the learning community. For teachers, it’s a flexible classroom tool that supports them and their students on the learning journey. For students, it’s a system designed to engage and motivate and support digital literacy<br>
<br>

Accessit Library provides highly streamlined Z39.50 and MARC 21 support to effortlessly catalog approximately 100 books in a minute.  It also provides editable substitution rules for pre and post processing of MARC 21 bibliographic data; another massive time saver.
<br>
<br>


As well as seamlessly streaming MARC 21 data into a catalog as ISBNs are scanned, librarians can also add records manually via a form-based view.  This manually created bibliographic record can then be converted to MARC if preferred.  Alternatively, for those that prefer to edit MARC records directly, Accessit Library provides a MARC Editor option as well.  Librarians can also search libraries via Z39.50.

<li>has independent and multi-lingual worksheets definition</li>
<li>allows single subfields units data entry, each one with a complete description</li>
<li>allows multiple subfields data entry</li>
<li>totally customisable</li>
<li>handling of authority files as external data bases</li>
<li>field or even subfield level user-help links</li>
<li>supports record validation through CDS/ISIS format</li>
<li>supports cross-data base copy/paste of records</li>
<li>supports Begin and End edition automated operations</li>
<li>built-in characters editing capabilities (uppercase to lowercase, etc) 
and give access to Windows’ character map</li>
<li>supports multiple users’ profiles</li>
<li>built-in Z39.50 client</li>

With a full suite of library automation modules, you can manage one or 
more libraries using any standard Web browser. Modules include basic and advanced 
searching, cataloging, circulation, patron management, inventory, reports, permissions 
and settings. Multiple libraries can be combined into a dynamic union catalog to 
allow multi-library searching and sharing of resources. A special program called 
LibraryWorld OPAC, Online Patron Access Catalog, is designed to allow library users 
easy access to the collection either directly or through a link on an organization's Web site.
Each module contains powerful functions, such as importing, exporting, and global change. 
Although easy to learn and use, this is a serious standards based library system designed 
to handle small to surprisingly large collections.

<dt>LibriVision</dt>
<dd>LibriVision is a Z39.50 compliant, web-based software. It can
be used as either an advanced tool for search and retrieval from
a number of databases or catalogs as determined by the user, or
as a web OPAC, with extended borrower services. LibriVision is a
Web Gateway, designed to cater for easy and efficient access to
multiple information channels. It provides access to non-web
based databases remotely. LibriVision may be used to search and
retrieve MARC 21 records from a database, which can be displayed
in several customizable formats. It supports the following MARC
21 formats: bibliographic, authority, and holdings. Likewise, it
also allows for the use of non-Roman scripts. Being Z39.50/ISO
23950 compliant, LibriVision supports search and present
functionality, the scan function, and history of result sets. To
date, LibriVision is being used at the National Library of
Australia, where it is used to update, in realtime, the National
Bibliography by some 600 remote libraries. In Australia, 
LibriVision is reffered to as “Kinetica Web”.

<dt>Verso</dt>

<dd>Verso is an evolutionary system, with roots in the most
versatile and easy to use library management system ever
developed. With the look and feel of the web, users hardly notice
where Verso ends and the web begins. For example, Verso provides
one search access for users to a wide range of information
sources and types. Incorporation of advanced capabilities such as
images, multimedia files, full text of articles and reports, and
links to on-line resources are standard features. Verso also
makes it easy to catalog, administer, and disseminate library
resources by enabling the creation of custom views of data for
library users by modifying the search screens and parameters. It
supports the MARC 21 bibliographic, holdings, classification and
community information formats and is also Z39.50 compliant.</dd>

<dt>Verso Consortia</dt>

<dd>Verso Consortia is fully MARC 21 compliant and offers the
most scaleable products in the industry. It also support Z39.50

<dd>Verso Enterprise provides for the storage, management and
dissemination of a wide variety of information. The Verso
Enterprise supports features such as full text storage and
retrieval, multimedia indexing and storage, web site indexing,
and customized user profiles. Each user can customize his/her own
desired notification and search patterns, and can be notified
automatically when his/her desired information is available. Or,
at a predetermined time, the latest information regarding added
books, articles, web sites updates, or any other information can
be pushed to the user. Libraries can also utilize this capability
to automatically inform users about the latest available
information. Verso Enterprise is designed for medium to large
libraries, consortia, or corporate wide information centers. It
supports the MARC 21 bibliographic, holdings, classification and
community information formats and is also Z39.50 compliant.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://www.milasweb.com">MiLAS Library Automation System</a></dt>
<dd>MiLAS is a fully web-based integrated library system first introduced in 
2003. It was developed with PhP-Java over a PostGreSQL database and it runs on a 
Linux (Debian distro) server so that end users do not need to install any client-side 
programs (the whole system runs in the browser.)<br><br>

The cataloging module supports full MARC21 standards with dynamic MARC field 
definitions that allow users to modify the underlying MARC structure 
as needed. There are also templates to facilitate data entry.<br><br>

The system administrator can modify users' acess levels and receive 
detailed log reports on system usage. The system admin can also modify 
different system parameters.<br><br>

Cataloging, OPAC, Circulation, User Management and Reports/Statistics 
are the standard modules. Z39.50, SIP2 and other additional features can be 
installed upon request.<br><br>

MiLAS is multilingual and new languages can be 
added to the main system by translating the language definition tables.
Non-Roman script support is included.<br><br>

The system is able to handle more than one library on 
a single server, either seperately or as a combined library 
cluster. This makes MiLAS suitable for institutions 
with branch libraries that want to handle all libraries from a central 
location. For example, the 
University of Ankara has more than 30 different faculty libraries 
collected as a cluster. The Ministry of Culture has more than 
1200 public libraries and 400 libraries clustered in a triple 
server system serving more than 6,000,000 records to more than 1,000 
librarians and over 5,000 daily public users.
