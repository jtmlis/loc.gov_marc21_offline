-------------------------------------------------------------------
*As an attachment to your proposal, please respond to the following
questions.

1. In the view of the proposing body, is the proposal so minor as
to require little or no cost consideration and no further response
to these guildline questions?



2. What identifiable groups will be affected by the proposed
change, e.g. public libraries, utilities, vendors of automated
library systems, LC, archivists, music catalogers?



3. Will adoption of the proposal effectively be optional or
mandatory by the groups affected?



4. Which groups will benefit from the proposal, and to what extent?
Is the benefit demonstrable in fiscal terms?



5. Has any study of the cost impact of this proposal been done? If
so, how are the results available to others?



6. If the proposing body sees the costs of the proposal as
potentially significant, what body do you believe would be the most
appropriate to carry out a study of those costs in order to gain
further information and precision?



7. Which groups will incur costs as a result of the proposal?



8. What kinds of costs are associated with the proposal, e.g.,
labor, training, data processing, communications? Are they one-time
or continuing costs?



9. Does the proposal have retrospective implications?  Will
existing records have to be changed, or materials reprocessed?



10. What proportion of materials processed, and of the records
created for them, will be affected?



11. Are codes or standards affected other than those specifically
addressed by the proposal?



12. Can the proposing body describe alternative ways of achieving
the ends of the proposal?
