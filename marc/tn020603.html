<P> As the result of East Timor's gaining its independence from Indonesia in May 
  2002, new country and geographic area codes are being defined for use in MARC 
  records. 
<P>The new codes for East Timor are:<br>
<ul>
  <li> <b>em </b>(Country code)<br>
  <li> <b>a-em </b>(Geographic area code) 
</ul>
<P> The Netherlands Antilles is an internally self-governing and integral part 
  of the Netherlands. It consists of the islands of Bonaire, Curacao, Saba, Saint 
  Eustatius and the southern half of the island of Saint Martin. Aruba was part 
  of the Netherlands Antilles until it seceded in 1986 to become a separate, autonomous 
  member of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Therefore, a new geographic area code 
  is being defined for Aruba. Moreover, because all of the separate islands of 
  the Netherlands Antilles have their geographic area codes, a geographic area 
  code is being defined for Bonaire for use in MARC records. 
<P>The new code for Aruba is: 
<ul>
  <li><b>nwaw</b> (Geographic area code)</li>
</ul>
<P>The new code for Bonaire is: 
<ul>
  <li><b>nwbn</b> (Geographic area code)</li>
</ul>
<P>Subscribers can anticipate receiving MARC records reflecting these changes 
  in all distribution services not earlier than September 3, 2002. Questions regarding 
  the country and geographic area codes should be directed to: </P>
