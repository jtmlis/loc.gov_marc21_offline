<h4>BookWhere</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>WebClarity Software Inc.’s BookWhere is a Z39.50 search client that allows users to search for metadata and cataloguing copy and export it in a variety of formats.  Records can be saved to a file and imported into most library and citation management systems.  Systems incorporating WebClarity's SEND-TO API can receive records directly and seamlessly.  BookWhere provides simple and expert search capabilities using keyword, Boolean, and cross-index searching as well as browse.</p>
<p>Two levels of batch searching are supported:  basic and enhanced (available with BookWhere Suite) where users can submit any number of searches across any number of databases. BookWhere uses unique heuristic record rating and scoring algorithms to help users pinpoint the most complete bibliographic records.</p>
<p>WebClarity manages the largest shared directory of databases in the world (currently 2900+).   BookWhere products are able to automatically synchronize (AutoSync) with this central directory for new additions and changes on a regular basis ensuring the most timely and seamless access of any 
service.</p>
<p>Users can also add their own databases and define login details on any database making it possible to search specific subscription-only or password-controlled databases, such as those provided by OCLC or Library and Archives Canada.  The end result is a consolidated search mechanism for all of your record sources, whether shared or subscription.</p>
<p>BookWhere Suite includes MARC record editing to assist with pre-processing.  Routines can be performed against a single record, or a batch of records all at once.  Macros can add, remove or append to tags and contain multiple iterations of these commands allowing you to in two quick keystrokes eliminate what might otherwise take multiple time-consuming steps.  It supports multiple character encoding schemas and can facilitate conversion between them:  utf-8 (Unicode), MARC-8 (ALA) and ISO 8859-1 (Latin 1).</p>
<p> 
BookWhere Online is a Web-based Z39.50 search tool.  It is an HTTP subscription service accessed via a standard Web browser including those used on Mac platforms.

<h4>Library Technologies, Inc.</h4>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Since 1989 Library Technologies, Inc. has authorized 200+ million bibliographic 
     records for over one thousand domestic and international libraries. A client 
     list is found on its web site and includes all types and sizes of libraries, 
     using every ILS vendor. In addition to LC name (personal, corporate, conference, 
     uniform titles and series) headings and LCSH topical and geographic headings, 
     libraries may authorize LC Children's subjects, Sears subjects, and NLM MeSH 
     subjects. Both &quot;limited review&quot; and full manual review authority 
     control options are offered. For limited review processing, databases under 
     one-half million catalog records usually take about three weeks to process. 
     Following batch authority control, libraries may opt to receive FTP- and/or 
     web-based continuing services for authorizing new cataloging and for keeping 
     current with Library of Congress revisions. LTI also delivers a broad range 
     of ancillary library database preparation services, including: duplicate record 
     resolution; union catalog creation; item field builds specific to each local 
     system vendor's requirements; smart and dumb photocomposed barcode labels; 
     item field remaps preliminary to migration from one ILS to another; and custom 
     bibliographic data projects.<br>

<h4>SLC Library Cataloguing Services</h4>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Special Libraries Cataloguing (SLC) provides MARC 21 bibliographic records
     via disk, tape, or FTP for library acquisitions. The records are created
     based on photocopies of title pages (recto and verso) with collation written on
     and may be loaded into any MARC 21 compliant OPAC. AACR2 1988 and LCSH are 
	 used. The library's choice of LCC, DDC, NLM, Moys and CanKF classifications 
	 is available. Print products, including spine and circulation labels, book 
	 catalogues, and catalogue cards are also available.<br>
