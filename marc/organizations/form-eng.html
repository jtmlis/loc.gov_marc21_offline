   <p>If you need more than three codes for entities within a larger organizations
  (for example, multiple schools within a school district), you may please follow
  the alternative instructions for multiple codes below. The Library of Congress
  will assign a MARC organization code to any organization that needs one, regardless
  of size. Large organizations may request separate codes for divisions or subordinate
  units. Codes are not assigned to individuals, projects, or programs. Requests for the assignment of new codes or changes involving
organizations in Canada, United Kingdom, or Germany are processed by <a href="http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/ill/index-e.html">Library and Archives Canada</a>, <a href="http://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/marcagency.html">The British Library</a>, and <a href="http://dispatch.opac.d-nb.de/DB=1.2/LNG=EN/">Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin</a>, respectively.</p> -->

<p>The codes are used in union catalogs to identify holding libraries and
  in MARC records to relate a record or specific information in a record to an
  organization. Two key MARC 21 fields requiring a MARC organization code are
  field 040 (Cataloging Source) and field 852 (Location). MARC organization (&#x0022;ORG&#x0022;) codes are unique identifiers consisting of one (1) to eight (8) alphabetic
  characters. The first part of the code is a geographic prefix that identifies
  the location (state and city, or, country and city) of the organization. The
  last part of the code takes letters from the name of the organization to complete
  the code. While the codes are case-independent in determining uniqueness, they
  are usually recorded in upper and lower case combinations that help identify
  the components of the code. For example: &#x0022;TxDaSOC&#x0022; is the MARC ORG code for the South Oak Cliff High School, in Dallas, Texas.</p>
<p>Please provide as much of the information below as possible. It will be
  loaded directly into a MARC code database used to publish the list of MARC
  organization codes. Use the [TAB] key to jump to each blank. Follow the guidelines
  for each piece of information below. Any incorrectly formatted information
  will have to be manually corrected and may delay the assignment of new codes.
  After filling out the form, press the &#x0022;Send Your Request&#x0022; button to submit your request via.</p>

<h3>For More Than Three (3) Related Codes</h3>
<p>For multiple code requests for entities within a larger organizations,
  (for example, multiple schools within a school district), please submit a list
  of organizations with their names, addresses, etc., via email to <a href="mailto:ndmso@loc.gov">ndmso@loc.gov.</a> Provide the same information as below, formatted as text. No email attachments
  will be accepted. This will expedite assigning multiple codes. Please note
  that requests for a large number of codes generally take longer to process.</p>
