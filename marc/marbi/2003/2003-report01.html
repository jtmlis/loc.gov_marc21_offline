<hr>
<h3>1. Introduction</h3>
<p>Last summer, the JSC Format Variation Working Group (FVWG) presented a Discussion 
  Paper to MARBI: <a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/marbi/2002/2002-dp08.html">2002-DP08</a> 
  &quot;Dealing with FRBR Expressions in MARC 21 <a href="2003-report01.html#note1">*</a>.&quot; 
  During discussion of that document at the 2002 annual ALA meeting, MARBI requested 
  that the Working Group continue to keep MARBI informed as the group's work progressed. 
  The following report contains an update of the Working Group's activities during 
  the past year. While it does not specifically discuss all of the concepts that 
  were presented in 2002-DP08, it should provide MARBI with an indication of the 
  directions that the Working Group is currently pursuing. </p>
<p>During the past year, the Format Variation Working Group has been working in 
  three different areas:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Writing revisions to Chapter 25 (Uniform Titles) in AACR2 to accommodate 
    the creation of headings at the FRBR level of &quot;expression.&quot;<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Discussing mechanisms for &quot;deconstructing the GMD,&quot; and for proposing 
    a mechanism to identify mode of expression within a catalog record.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Working with system vendors and utilities that are currently incorporating 
    the FRBR model into their databases, and discussing best practices in this 
    area. </li>
</ol>
<p>In February, the JSC distributed preliminary documents from the Working Group 
  related to the first two of these areas to its constituent bodies for comment. 
  These documents were discussed at the April 2003 JSC meeting, and the Working 
  Group received further direction from the JSC for how to proceed with moving 
  these two projects forward during the next year.</p>
<h3>2. Rewriting AACR Chapter 25</h3>
<p>As one of its efforts to incorporate FRBR into AACR, the JSC has asked the 
  Working Group to propose additions to Chapter 25 that would allow catalogers 
  to construct uniform title-like headings that would identify not only a particular 
  work (as currently in AACR2) but also a particular expression of a work. Rules 
  for constructing these headings would be conceptually an extension of the rules 
  already in place in Chapter 25. The FVWG is working under the assumption that 
  headings at this level of specificity (expression) would remain optional within 
  AACR, as the use of uniform titles is currently optional. The headings would 
  only be desirable in a limited number of circumstances. For example, when a 
  library catalog contains voluminous entries for certain works that appear in 
  the catalog in many expressions and manifestations, it may be desirable to collocate 
  the entries first under the work, and then under the expression. </p>
<p>The Working Group's first document suggesting changes to Chapter 25 (4JSC/Chair/71/Rev/Chair 
  follow-up/4) took a fairly minimalist approach to revision. While the JSC concluded 
  that this was a useful and necessary exercise, the JSC and its constituents 
  felt that much more was needed. Thus the Working Group has now been asked to 
  take a &quot;fresh look&quot; at the entire chapter, rather than to work primarily 
  with the structure of rules that is already there. In particular, we have been 
  asked to include more discussion of the different functions of uniform titles, 
  delineate situations where uniform titles are useful, and explain the concepts 
  behind them. The Working Group will be proposing an outline for a redesign of 
  the entire chapter to the JSC in August. </p>
<p>As the revision of Chapter 25 progresses, it is possible that some revisions 
  to both the bibliographic and authority formats may need to be considered to 
  accommodate expression-level headings. If so, the Working Group will present 
  another Discussion Paper to MARBI that deals with these issues. </p>
<h3>3. Deconstructing the GMD/Mode of Expression</h3>
<p>Last October, the JSC presented the Working Group with an additional charge: 
  to explore the feasibility of &quot;deconstructing&quot; the GMD through the 
  use of a term or device in the bibliographic record to represent the mode of 
  expression, moving terms representing physical format and form of carrier to 
  the physical description or to notes, and to make recommendations to the JSC 
  on how the mode of expression could be represented in the bibliographic record. 
</p>
<p>In February, the Working Group presented a preliminary discussion of these 
  issues to the JSC and its constituents (4JSC/Chair/71/Rev/2/Chair follow-up). 
  In response to this document, the JSC recommended the next steps for the Working 
  Group in this area. The JSC requested that the Working Group clearly distinguish 
  between the analysis that is needed to deconstruct the GMD, on the one hand, 
  and the synthesis that will then be needed to propose rules for the description. 
  For the analysis, the Working Group has been asked to develop a more rigorous 
  taxonomy of terms for mode of expression and ensure that the terms are at an 
  appropriate level of specificity for the user community. These terms need not 
  be user friendly as they are for analysis and not for display. Once the analysis 
  is done, the Working Group will work on display terms for mode of expression 
  that would actually be useful to users. </p>
<p>The Working Group will be working to further define the objective that would 
  be achieved by coding the mode of expression in a catalog record. The JSC asked 
  the Working Group to continue thinking through the function or hoped-for function 
  of the GMD and think of other ways to achieve this functionality, if desirable.</p>
<p>The FVWG's exploration of this topic remains at a very preliminary stage. It 
  will continue to keep MARBI informed as it progresses in this area through progress 
  reports or a future discussion paper. </p>
<h3>Working with System Vendors on FRBR</h3>
<p>The Format Variation Working Group is continuing to work with system vendors 
  and utilities (so far primarily OCLC and VTLS) that are currently incorporating 
  the FRBR model into their databases. As a part of that effort, we are establishing 
  liaisons with any vendor who has an interest in this area, whether or not they 
  are currently implementing FRBR. So far, the Working Group has established liaisons 
  with Digibis, Endeavor, Ex Libris, Innovative Interfaces, OCLC, The Library 
  Corporation, and VTLS. </p>
<p>The Working Group feels that it is important to maintain these liaison relationships 
  so that we can:</p>
<ol>
  <li>study various implementations of FRBR, especially in MARC-based systems<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>keep vendors informed of the direction that rule revisions are going to 
    support FRBR and<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>encourage vendors to support FRBR-related development in their systems </li>
</ol>
<p>The Working Group's approach so far has been to look at each system and identify 
  those features that work well in creating intelligible, collocated catalog displays 
  for users. Based partly upon our experiences in working with system developers 
  in this way, the Working Group plans to compile a list of criteria for evaluating 
  online systems that organize bibliographic data according to the FRBR model.</p>
<p>System vendors and utilities that do not currently have a liaison relationship 
  with the JSC Format Variation Working Group are encouraged to establish one 
  by contacting the Working Group Chair, Jennifer Bowen at <a href="http://www.loc.gov/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d0bab2bfa7b5be90bcb9b2a2b1a2a9fea2bfb3b8b5a3a4b5a2feb5b4a5"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="563c3439213338163a3f342437242f782439353e332522332478333223">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.
