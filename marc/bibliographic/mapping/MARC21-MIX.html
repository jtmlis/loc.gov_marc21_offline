<h1>Analysis of Data Overlap Between the MARC21 Bibliographic Format</h1>
<h1> and the MIX Data Dictionary (ANSI/NISO Z39.87-2006)</h1>
<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>The present paper examines The <a href="../ecbdhome.html">MARC21 Bibliographic format</a>  and the <a href="http://loc.gov/standards/mix/">MIX Data Dictionary</a> for correspondences in the data which they
  accommodate.&nbsp; Though the data dictionary
  is actually defined by ANSI/NISO Z39.87-2006, it will, for convenience, be
  called MIX throughout this report, employing the name of an important XML
  schema, maintained by the Library of Congress, for implementing the standard.</p>
<p>This analysis, conducted following
  a similar one relating elements of MARC21 to those of the PREMIS Data
  Dictionary, invites some comparisons of PREMIS and MIX and their relationships
  to MARC21.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The PREMIS and MIX metadata
  schemes are similar in focusing on the management of collections of digital
  resources.&nbsp; In MIX this orientation is made
  explicit by including in the documentation of each element a section categorizing
  anticipated use.&nbsp; &ldquo;User&rdquo; use is attributed
  to only about one third of the elements; more than half of those are elements
  of GPSData.&nbsp; The other two MIX
  categories, &ldquo;system&rdquo; and &ldquo;manager&rdquo; are each attributed to more than twice as
  many elements as for the &ldquo;user.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
  contrast, MARC has throughout its history been centered on &ldquo;user&rdquo; metadata.</p>
<p>PREMIS concentrates on data relevant
  to managing preservation operations, organizing the data into various related
  entities (Object, Event, Agent, Rights.)&nbsp; The scope of MIX is more limited in the materials it covers, still
  raster images, but provides for description of these objects in significantly greater
  technical detail.</p>
<p>PREMIS relies heavily on the use
  of string datatype values from controlled vocabularies defined externally from
  the scheme itself.&nbsp; MIX, on the other hand, employs a variety of datatypes.&nbsp;
  In addition to using string datatype values from &quot;enumerated&quot; lists,
  which represent roughly one third of all datatype options in MIX and which are
  akin to PREMIS's use of string values from controlled vocabularies, MIX also
  relies on the simple string datatype, which is the second most common datatype
  in MIX, and several numeric datatypes, such as the &quot;positive integer&quot;
  datatype, the &quot;non-negative real&quot; datatype, and the
  &quot;rational&quot; datatype.</p>
<p>The string data type and the
  various numeric types represent potentially better correspondence between the
  ways MIX and MARC21 record data than is the case between PREMIS and MARC21,
  specifically with reference to the latter&rsquo;s use of free text notes.&nbsp; (Whether the apparent preference in MIX for
  text values over codes in elements of the enumerated type is helpful in this
  regard is harder to evaluate.)&nbsp; However, most
  of the data collected by MIX are of a nature so technical and specialized that
  only rarely have provisions been made for them in MARC21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Findings of this investigation are
  expressed in a pair of tables that have the same contents arranged
  differently.&nbsp; Table <i><a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/mapping/MARC21vsMIXtable.html">MARC21 vs. MIX</a></i> is ordered by MARC tag and subfield code; table <i><a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/mapping/MIXvsMARC21table.html">MIX vs. MARC21</a></i> follows the order of MIX
  data elements of the Data Dictionary as presented in Z39.87-2006.&nbsp; Though the current version (2.0) of the MIX
  schema includes the conversion of a few of the Z39.87-2006 elements to Containers with
  new, more specific elements defined within them, these elaborations occur only
  in areas that are not accommodated in the MARC21 format; hence the findings are
  equally applicable to MIX versions 1.0 and 2.0.</p>
<p><strong>NOTES ON THE ANALYSIS</strong></p>
<p>Certain elements are noted in MIX
  documentation as having been &ldquo;drawn from the PREMIS data element set.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the tables, these elements are flagged by
  an asterisk following their numeric identifiers.</p>
<p>Where feasible, the tables work at
  MARC21 subfield and MIX element levels.&nbsp; Departures from this principle occur for two main reasons.</p>
<ol>
  <li>There are situations in which a single
    MARC21 field or subfield represents, implicitly or explicitly, a Type/Value
    pair of MIX elements.&nbsp; For succinctness,
    a single reference to the appropriate container is used in these cases.</li>
  <li>Sometimes the specification of a MARC21 subfield
    relates in an uncertain or complex way to the elements of a MIX Container.&nbsp; Creating a table entry at the Container level
    expresses the relationship as clearly as seems possible; <i>viz</i>, fields 300$c and 534$e.</li>
</ol>
<p>The tables have
  been built assuming that it is preferable to identify possible correspondences
  that may be tenuous, or even erroneous, than to omit a connection of importance
  inadvertently. &nbsp;Users of these tables who
  are more knowledgeable of their or other&rsquo;s MIX implementations may be able to
  eliminate some table entries as universally inappropriate or too rare to be
  worthy of consideration.&nbsp; For instance, the
  data in field 007 positions for computer files may be deemed useless in contrast
  to the detail afforded by MIX.</p>
<p>One situation is the relationship
  between MIX GPSData and MARC21 fields 034, 255 and 007 of the remote sensing
  image type (i.e., 007/01=r).&nbsp; On the
  surface, it might seem like the MARC fields for recording Geospatial data are
  good fits with MIX GPSData,&nbsp; but MIX's
  GPSData and MARC's 034 and 255 fields are not trying to record quite the same
  information.&nbsp;Typically, GPS data records the point in place where a
  digital photograph was recorded.&nbsp; MARC 034 and 255 attempt to describe the
  geographic bounding of a (cartographic) image.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It should be noted that particular
  MARC21/MIX correspondences depend on whether one contemplates a MARC record
  describing the same electronic object as a MIX object or one in single record
  style that essentially describes the Source of the MIX image.&nbsp; The tables attempt to cover both cases. </p>
<p>The process of deciding what kinds
  of data are expected in any subfield of interest, particularly in free text
  note fields, was guided by the examples provided in the full online MARC21
  Bibliographic Format document.&nbsp; No
  attempt was made to search for additional examples in library databases.&nbsp; The many MIX elements for which no MARC21
  homes have been identified could, of course, be included in general notes tagged
  500.&nbsp; This seems unlikely, however,
  because the 500 note is typically displayed in library catalogs while the
  technical character of most MIX elements would rarely be need to be exposed in
  this way.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>The investigator is aware of his
  tendency to think of metadata comparisons of this sort in terms of conversions
  from one scheme to another.&nbsp; That is a
  matter more limited than the general question of data overlap.&nbsp; Nevertheless, that mindset may have crept
  occasionally into the language used to talk about the relationships of certain
  data elements between MARC21 and MIX.&nbsp; This should not seriously affect interpretation of the findings.</p>
