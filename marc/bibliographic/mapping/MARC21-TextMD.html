<h1>Analysis of Data Overlap Between the MARC21 Bibliographic Format </h1>
<h1>and the TextMD Data Element Set</h1>
<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>The present paper examines the <a href="../ecbdhome.html">MARC21 Bibliographic format</a> and the <a href="http://loc.gov/standards/textMD/">TextMD element set</a>  for correspondences in the data
  which they accommodate.&nbsp; TextMD&rsquo;s area of concern is that of textual
  digital entities.&nbsp; TextMD is introduced
  as having been developed as an extension schema for METS, which explains
  TextMD&rsquo;s having no element that serves as an identifier of the object being
  described, an omission that makes the statement that the TextMD schema &ldquo;could
  also exist as a standalone document&rdquo; challenging to comprehend. </p>
<p>The precise number of TextMD
  elements is relatively small, the exact number depending on whether attributes
  are counted and on which version of the schema is being examined.&nbsp; This analysis considered version 3.01, but is
  equally applicable to version 2.2 because the newly added elements have no
  discernable equivalents, or at least no specific homes, in MARC21. &nbsp;</p>
<p>TextMD values are generally expressed
  as strings, although there is one (<i>byte_size</i>)
  that requires an integer, and the elements added for version 3.01 are described
  as &ldquo;tokens&rdquo; in the schema, where the enumerated values appear as strings.&nbsp; Roughly three fourths of string values, so
  denominated, accept free text; the remainder are restricted to the values in
  enumerated lists.</p>
<p>Findings of this investigation are
  expressed in a pair of tables that have the same contents arranged
  differently.&nbsp; Table <i><a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/mapping/MARC21vsTextMDtable.html">MARC21 vs. TextMD</a></i> is ordered by MARC tag and subfield code; table <i><a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/mapping/TextMDvsMARC21table.html">TextMD vs. MARC21</a></i> follows the order of
  MIX data elements as presented in its XML schema.&nbsp; Data elements are not identified by numbers
  in the TextMD documentation, but have been assigned them here to facilitate
  sorting the tables.</p>
<p><strong>NOTES ON THE ANALYSIS</strong></p>
<p>Names of TextMD elements and
  attributes are italicized in these notes.</p>
<p>With the exception of fields and
  elements referring to the language of the text object, correspondences between
  MARC21 and TextMD are fuzzy.&nbsp; The tables
  have been built assuming that it is preferable to identify possible
  correspondences that may be tenuous, or even erroneous, than to omit a
  connection of importance inadvertently. &nbsp;Users
  of these tables who are more knowledgeable of their or other&rsquo;s TextMD implementations
  may be able to eliminate some table entries as universally inappropriate or too
  rare to be worthy of consideration. </p>
<p>The MARC21 fields (041, 546) and TextMD
  elements (<i>language, alt_language</i>) concerning
  the language(s) of the text object are all repeatable, making it fairly easy to
  translate the information from one scheme to the other, having only to convert
  between MARC codes and ISO 639-2 in most cases, and to supply the necessary authority
  information in either scheme. When 041 and 546 are absent, the non-repeatable
  MARC21 element 008/35-37 can be used similarly for simple cases. </p>
<p>&nbsp;Certain positions in the MARC 007 field of a
  computer file record may of limited use in formulating a TextMD <i>QUALITY</i> attribute, especially if that
  attribute is not expected to be any more precise than the single word &ldquo;good&rdquo; as
  shown in the example provided in TextMD documentation.&nbsp; </p>
<p>MARC has a field (514) called Data
  Quality Note whose name suggests relevance to the TextMD <i>QUALITY</i> attribute, but the definitions of
  514 subfields all point toward limiting the use of the field to cartographic
  resources, hence unhelpful for text objects. </p>
<p>The tables show MARC21 field 538
  (System Details Note) as relating to TextMD containers (<i>encoding, character_info</i>) and distinct elements (<i>printRequirements, viewingRequirements</i>)
  on the basis of examples given in MARC documentation, but it seems thoroughly
  possible that information concerning other elements (e.g. <i>markup_basis, markup_language</i>) might also be encountered in 538.&nbsp; Documentation of 538 does not distinguish
  between the computer requirements of the system that created the digital object
  (corresponding to TextMD <i>encoding_platform</i>)
  and those concerned with viewing or printing the object. </p>
<p>MARC21 Field 856 (Electronic
  Location and Access,) true to its title, is apt to offer little information
  that will fit in the TextMD <i>encoding</i> or <i>character_info</i> containers, possible
  exceptions being $c (Compression information.) as part of <i>encoding_software</i>, and $r (Settings) for determining <i>byte_size</i>, although the $r expression of
  the latter has begun to look quaint.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, 856 may contain,
  in various subfields, data appropriate to TextMD <i>printRequirements</i> and/or <i>viewingRequirements</i> inasmuch as those elements are specified to be free text strings.</p>
<p>The tables cite field 500 as the
  possible MARC21 home for data that would appear in the catch-all TextMD
  elements <i>processingNote</i> and <i>textNote</i>, but, depending on the content
  of individual instances of those elements, somewhat more specific 5xx notes may
  occasionally be more appropriate. </p>
<p>Data in new TextMD version 3.01
  elements (e.g.<i> representationSequence,
    lineLayout, lineOrientation, characterFlow</i>) might also be reflected in
  somewhat different form in MARC21 note fields such as 500 and 546, particularly
  when the text of the object is written in non-Latin scripts. </p>
<p>The process of deciding what kinds
  of data are expected in any MARC21 subfield of interest, particularly in free
  text note fields, has been guided by the examples provided in the full online
  MARC21 Bibliographic Format document.&nbsp; No
  attempt was made to search for additional examples in library databases. </p>
<p>The investigator is aware of his
  tendency to think of metadata comparisons of this sort in terms of conversions
  from one scheme to another.&nbsp; That is a
  matter more limited than the general question of data overlap.&nbsp; Nevertheless, that mindset may have crept
  occasionally into the language used to talk about the relationships of certain
  data elements between MARC21 and TextMD.&nbsp; This should not seriously affect interpretation of the findings.</p>
<p>In carrying out this task, the investigator noted that re-examining some features may serve the scheme well in the long run.&nbsp; Here are some things to consider.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Unify element naming
    conventions.&nbsp; The use of camelCase in
    some element names, words separated by underscores in others, and all-caps for
    one attribute name is prone to cause error.</li>
  <li>Eliminate use of the same name for
    elements that are functionally different.&nbsp; The name<i> linebreak</i> seems to be
    applied to the same datum in two ways, once as an attribute of an element in the
    encoding container, once as an element in different container.&nbsp; The name <i>encoding</i> is employed for a container and also for an attribute of an element in a
    different container. &nbsp;(The latter usage
    is further complicated by its relation to the <i>charset </i>element. That is not a fault of TextMD; rather it devolves
    from the IANA character set name list&rsquo;s inclusion of names for both character repertoires
    and encodings.)&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
