<h1>Analysis of Data Overlap Between the MARC21 Bibliographic Format </h1>
<h1>and the PREMIS Data Dictionary</h1>
<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>The task of relating contents of
  <a href="../ecbdhome.html">MARC21 Bibliographic format</a>  and the <a href="http://loc.gov/standards/premis/">PREMIS Data Dictionary</a>  confronts a variety of challenges.</p>
<p>MARC21 was designed primarily as
  an exchange format for bibliographic data pertaining to a wide variety of
  materials, a purpose requiring its specification to be understood and applied
  similarly by users in many libraries.&nbsp; For some data elements &ndash; countries, languages, relators, etc. &ndash; code
  lists are provided that provide uniformity of content for several fields.&nbsp; However, most fields accept free text, with
  issues of intelligible display frequently having priority over machine-processable
  uniformity&nbsp;&nbsp; (The issue arose, for
  example, on the MARC Forum in a discussion about copyright jurisdiction in the
  proposal establishing field 542 (Information Relating to Copyright Status)). &nbsp;Such consistency as is achieved in the free
  text fields results from application of a set of cataloging rules employed by
  the majority of MARC21 users.&nbsp; These
  rules are distinct from the format, and, in an earlier form, antedated and
  influenced the creation of the MARC format.</p>
<p>In contrast, PREMIS is intended to
  facilitate the management of preservation metadata primarily within individual
  digital archives or repositories.&nbsp; Data
  exchange has been a secondary concern.&nbsp; The specification shows this clearly, allowing each PREMIS instantiation
  a great deal of latitude in what data are recorded, and in the vocabularies
  employed.&nbsp; The phrase, &ldquo;Value should be
  taken from a controlled vocabulary,&rdquo; present as a data constraint for many
  PREMIS semantic units is indicative of this design philosophy, the implication being
  that the choice of vocabulary may be a local one.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The result of these differences in
  purpose is that the two schemes focus, in their concern for particularity, on
  rather different metadata elements.&nbsp; Even
  when the same metadata particular is represented in the two schemes, it is
  almost never done in a way that would allow the value to be transferred
  directly or unambiguously from PREMIS to MARC21, or vice versa.&nbsp; MARC21 is at a disadvantage in the areas on
  which PREMIS concentrates, because much of the MARC specification was done when
  preservation of digital resources was a field in its infancy. &nbsp;The PREMIS Data Dictionary embodies an attempt
  to codify metadata needs in this area where standards and best practices are
  only emerging.&nbsp; There are no longstanding
  traditions to guide (or hamper) the effort.</p>
<p><strong>NOTES ON THE ANALYSIS</strong></p>
<p>The present paper examines these
  two metadata schemes for correspondences in the data which they
  accommodate.&nbsp; The findings are expressed
  in a pair of tables that have the same contents arranged differently.&nbsp; Table <i><a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/mapping/MARC21vsPREMIStable.html">MARC21
    vs. PREMIS</a></i> is ordered by MARC tag and subfield code; table <i><a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/mapping/PREMISvsMARC21table.html">PREMIS vs. MARC21</a></i> follows the order of PREMIS
  semantic units specified in version 2.0 of the Data Dictionary.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Where feasible, the tables work at
  MARC subfield and PREMIS subunit levels.&nbsp; Departures from this principle occur for two main reasons.</p>
<ol>
  <li>There are a number of situations in which
    a single MARC element represents, implicitly or explicitly, a Type/Value pair
    of PREMIS subunits.&nbsp; For succinctness, a
    single reference to the appropriate container is used in these cases.</li>
  <li>&nbsp;Sometimes
    the specification of a MARC field relates in an uncertain or complex way at the
    subfield level to the subunits of a PREMIS container.&nbsp; Creating a table entry at the field/container
    level expresses the relationship as clearly as seems possible; <i>viz</i>, fields 506 and 542.</li>
</ol>
<p>The tables have been built
  assuming that it is preferable to identify possible correspondences that may be
  tenuous, or even erroneous, than inadvertently to omit a connection of
  importance.&nbsp; Two systematic exceptions
  from the policy of inclusiveness should be mentioned.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Fields from bibliographic format ranges
    1XX, 6XX, and 7XX-75X have not been included as potential PREMIS agents.</li>
  <li>Numbers based on knowledge classification
    (fields 050 et al.) have been excluded as possible
    linkingIntellectualEntityIdentifiers since their primary purpose is to bring
    materials together rather than to distinguish between them at levels useful for
    preservation management.</li>
</ol>
<p>Users of these tables who are more
  knowledgeable of their and other's PREMIS implementations may be able to
  eliminate some table entries as universally inappropriate or too rare to be
  worthy of consideration.&nbsp; For instance,
  subfield 260$f, manufacturer&rsquo;s name, is listed as a possible agentName,
  although the likelihood of that relationship&rsquo;s being useful seems small.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Certain subfields whose roles in
  this context are obscure have generally been omitted.&nbsp; Their evaluation will require examination of individual
  instances.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Subfield $u when it contains a URI in
    fields other than 856; i.e, in notes 538, 540, 542, and 583.&nbsp; In these cases the entity to which the URI
    points may provide data that might otherwise be present in one or more other
    subfields, though it is not possible abstractly to predict what data are to be
    found via the URI link.</li>
  <li>Subfield $3 &ldquo;Materials specified.&rdquo; can be
    significant in defining a specific electronic resource within the context of a
    complex MARC record, but its relation to PREMIS semantic units may be limited
    at most to construction of a linkingIntellectualEntity Identifier.</li>
</ol>
<p>In general, there are no table
  entries for semantic units whose names begin with the element &ldquo;linking,&rdquo; because
  their type and value subunits inherit data from similarly named units lacking
  the &ldquo;linking&rdquo; prefix.&nbsp; There are
  exceptions.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Entries have been provided for
    linkingAgentRole (2.6.3 and 4.1.8.3) because role is not a semantic unit of an
    Agent entity.</li>
  <li>Entries have been provided for
    linkingIntellectualEntityIdentifier because there is no
    intellectualEntityIdentifier semantic unit in PREMIS.&nbsp; </li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, this analysis examined
  the question of MARC21 data that a repository might find appropriate to include
  in its PREMIS database, but that appear to fit only in the &ldquo;Extension&rdquo; containers.&nbsp; Sometimes it is unclear whether these
  marginal data would be appropriate to &ldquo;Note&rdquo; subunits.&nbsp; In the end, only the rightsExtension (4.2)
  appears in the tables; <i>viz</i>. fields
  355 and 506. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The process of deciding what kinds
  of data are expected in any subfield of interest, particularly in free text
  note fields, was guided by the examples provided in the full online MARC21
  Bibliographic Format document.&nbsp; No
  attempt was made to search for additional examples in library databases.</p>
<p>The investigator is aware of his
  tendency to think of metadata comparisons of this sort in terms of conversions
  from one scheme to another.&nbsp; That is a
  matter more limited than the general question of data overlap, and one that the
  character of these two schemes renders impracticable.&nbsp; Nevertheless, that mindset has crept
  occasionally into the language used to talk about the relationships between
  certain data elements and semantic units.&nbsp; This fact should not seriously affect interpretation of the findings,
  but it seems wise to mention it.</p>
