<h4><a name="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h4>
<p>MARC 21 is an implementation of the American national standard, <em>Information
Interchange Format</em> (ANSI Z39.2) and its international counterpart, <em>Format for
Information Exchange</em> (ISO 2709).  These standards specify the requirements for a
generalized interchange format that will accommodate data describing all forms of materials
susceptible to bibliographic description, as well as related information such as authority,
classification, community information, and holdings data.  The standards present a generalized
structure for records, but do not specify the content of the record and do not, in general, assign
meaning to tags, indicators, or data element identifiers.  Specification of these elements are
provided by particular implementations of the standards.  The following description of the
MARC 21 record structure indicates the specific choices made for the MARC 21 implementation
of the standards.</p>

<h4><a name="char">CHARACTER SETS</a></h4>
<p>MARC 21 records are character encoded, including all lengths.  In this section on
Record
Structure, elements may be specified as ASCII numeric characters, ASCII
lowercase alphabetic
characters,
ASCII uppercase alphabetic characters, ASCII graphic symbol characters, ASCII
control characters, ASCII blank character, ASCII graphic characters, or MARC 21
characters.  The
section on
<a href="speccharintro.html">Character Sets</a>
 defines the
repertoire and encoding of each of these subsets of
characters.</p>

<h4><a name="genrec">GENERAL RECORD STRUCTURE</a></h4>
<p>The general structure of a record is represented schematically below.</p>
<p><strong>Structure of a MARC 21
Record</strong></p>
<pre>  LEADER  DIRECTORY  FT  CONTROL_NUMBER_FIELD  FT

      CONTROL_FIELD_1  FT   ...   CONTROL_FIELD_n  FT

          DATA_FIELD_1  FT   ...   DATA_FIELD_n  FT  RT 
</pre>
<p>Each record begins with a <strong> leader, </strong> which is a fixed field
containing
information for the
processing of the
record.  Following the leader is the <strong> directory, </strong> which is an
index to the
location of the <strong> variable fields </strong>
(control
and data) within the record.  The fields following the directory are all variable
fields.  The first
variable field
is the <strong> control number field, </strong> which contains an ASCII graphic
character
string uniquely associated
with
the
record by the organization transmitting the record.  Following the control number
field are the
rest
of the
<strong> control fields, </strong> which contain information useful or required
for the
processing of the record. 
Following the
control fields are <strong> data fields, </strong> which contain general data.  A
<strong> field terminator </strong> (FT), ASCII control character
1E(hex), is
used to terminate the directory and each variable field within the record.  A <strong> record
terminator </strong>
(RT),
ASCII control character 1D(hex), is used as the final character of the record,
following
the field
terminator of
the
last
data field. 
These elements of the record are described in more detail in the following
sections.</p>

<h4><a name="leader">LEADER</a></h4>
<p>The leader is the first field in the record and has a fixed length of 24
octets (character
positions 0-23).  Only ASCII graphic characters are allowed in the Leader.  The
structure of the leader as defined in MARC 21 is represented schematically below. 
The
numbers
indicate
the character positions occupied by each part of the leader.</p>

</pre>
<p><strong>Record length </strong> (character positions 00-04), contains
a
five-character ASCII numeric
string equal
to the length of the entire record, including itself and the record terminator.  The
five-character
numeric string
is right justified and unused positions contain zeroes (zero fill).  The maximum
length of a record
is
99999
octets.  </p>
<p><strong> Record status </strong> (character position 05), contains an ASCII
graphic
character which indicates
the
relation
of the record to a file (e.g., new, updated, etc.).</p>
<p><strong> Type of record </strong> (character position 06), contains an ASCII
graphic
character which specifies
the
characteristics and defines the components of the record.</p>
<p><strong> Implementation-defined </strong> (character positions 07-08).  ANSI
Z39.2 and ISO 2709 reserve character positions 07-08 for definition by a particular
implementation. 
The
individual MARC 21 formats define
these
character
positions if needed.  Positions may contain only ASCII graphic
characters. Any position not defined contains a blank.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Bibliographic level </strong> (bibliographic record,
character
position 07): contains
an ASCII graphic character which
also provides information about the components and characteristics of the
record.</li>
<li><strong>Kind of data </strong>(community information record,
character
position 07): contains
an ASCII graphic character which
also provides information about the components and characteristics of the
record.</li>
<li><strong>Type of control </strong>(bibliographic record, character
position 08): contains
an ASCII graphic character which
also provides information about the components and characteristics of the
record.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Character coding scheme</strong> (character position 09), contains
a code that identifies the character coding scheme used in a record.</p>
<p><strong> Indicator count </strong> (character position 10), contains 
one ASCII numeric character specifying the
number of indicators occurring in each variable data field.  In MARC 21 records, the
indicator
count
is always
2.</p>
<p><strong> Subfield code length </strong> (character position 11), contains one
ASCII
numeric character specifying the sum of the lengths of the delimiter and the data
element identifier used in the
record.  In
MARC 21 records,
the subfield code length is always 2.  The ANSI Z39.2 and ISO 2709 name for this data
element is <strong> identifier length </strong>.</p>
<p><strong> Base address of data </strong> (character positions 12-16), contains
five
ASCII numeric characters that specify the first character position of the first
variable
field in the record.  It is equal to the sum
of
the lengths
of the leader and the directory, including the field terminator at the end of the
directory.  The
number
is right
justified and unused positions contain zeroes (zero fill).</p>
<p><strong> Implementation-defined </strong> (character positions 17-19).  ANSI
Z39.2 and ISO 2709 reserve character positions 17-19 for definition by a particular
implementation. 
The
individual MARC 21 formats define
these
character
positions is needed. Positions may contain only ASCII graphic
characters. Any position not defined contains a blank.</p>
<p><strong> Entry map </strong> (character positions 20-23), contains four single
digit
ASCII numeric characters
that
specify the structure of the entries in the directory.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong> Length of length-of-field </strong> (character position 20):
specifies
the length of that part
of each
 directory entry; in MARC 21 records, it is always set to 4.</li>
<li><strong> Length of starting-character-position </strong> (character  
position 21): specifies the length
of that part of each directory entry; in MARC 21 records, it is always set to
5.</li>
<li> <strong> Length of implementation-defined </strong> (character
position 22):
specifies that part of
each directory entry; in MARC 21 records, a directory entry does not contain an
implementation-defined portion, therefore this position is always set to 0.</li>

<h4><a name="direct">DIRECTORY</a></h4>
<p>A directory entry in MARC 21 is made up of a tag, length-of-field, and field
starting position. 
The
directory begins in character position 24 of the record and ends with a field
terminator.  It is of
variable length
and consists of a series of fixed fields, referred to as "entries."  One entry is
associated with each
variable field
(control or data) present in the record.  Each directory entry is 12 characters in
length; the
structure
of each
entry as defined in MARC 21 is represented schematically below.  The numbers indicate
the
character
positions
occupied by the parts of the entry.</p>
<p><strong> Structure of a Directory Entry in MARC 21
Records</strong></p>
<pre>    TAG     LENGTH_OF_FIELD     STARTING_CHARACTER_POSITION
    00-02   03-06               07-11
</pre>
<p><strong> Tag </strong> (character positions 00-02), consists of three ASCII
numeric
characters or ASCII
alphabetic
characters (uppercase or lowercase, but not both) used to identify or label an
associated variable
field. 
The
MARC 21 formats have used only numeric tags.  The tag is stored only in the directory
entry for
the
field; it
does not appear in the variable field itself.</p>
<p><strong> Length of field </strong> (character positions 03-06), contains four
ASCII
numeric characters which give
the length,
expressed as a decimal number, of the variable field to which the entry corresponds. 
This length
includes the
indicators, subfield codes, data and field terminator associated with the field.  A
field length
number
of fewer
than four digits is right justified and unused positions contain zeroes (zero fill). 
MARC 21 sets
the
length of
the length of field portion of the entry at four characters, thus a field may contain a
maximum of
9999 octets.</p>
<p><strong> Starting character position </strong> (character positions 07-11),
contains
five ASCII numeric
characters
which
give the starting character position, expressed as a decimal number, of the variable
field to which
the
entry
corresponds relative to the base address of data of the record.  A starting
character position of
fewer
than five
digits is right justified and unused positions contain zeroes (zero fill).</p>
<p><strong> Order of entries </strong>  Directory entries for control fields
precede
entries for data fields.  Entries
for control fields
are
sequenced
by tag in increasing numerical order.  Entries for data fields are arranged in
ascending order
according
to the
first character of the tag, with numeric characters preceding alphabetic
characters.  See Variable Fields below for order requirements for the fields to
which
the directory entries point.</p>

<h4><a name="varifields">VARIABLE FIELDS</a></h4>
<p>The variable fields follow the leader and the directory in the record and consist
of control
fields
and data
fields.  Control fields precede data fields in the record and are arranged in the
same sequence as
the
corresponding entries in the directory.  The sequence in which data fields are
stored in the record
is
not
necessarily the same as the order of the corresponding directory entries.</p>
<p><strong> Control fields </strong> in MARC 21 formats are assigned tags
beginning
with two zeroes. 
They are
comprised
of data and a field terminator; they do not contain indicators or subfield codes. 
The control
number
field is
assigned tag 001 and contains the control number of the record.  Each record
contains only one
control number
field (with tag 001), which is to be located at the base address of data.</p>
<p><strong> Data fields </strong> in MARC 21 formats are assigned tags beginning
with
ASCII numeric
characters
other than
two zeroes.  Such fields contain indicators and subfield codes, as well as data and
a field
terminator. 
There
are no restrictions on the number, length, or content of data fields other than
those already stated
or
implied,
e.g., those resulting from the limitation of total record length.  The structure of
a data field is
shown
schematically below.</p>
<p><strong>Structure of a Variable Data Field in MARC 21
Records</strong></p>
<pre>  INDICATOR_1  INDICATOR_2  DELIMITER  DATA_ELEMENT_IDENTIFIER_1

      DATA_ELEMENT_1  ...  DELIMITER  DATA_ELEMENT_IDENTIFIER_n  

          DATA_ELEMENT_n  FT
</pre>
<p><strong> Indicators </strong> are the first two characters in every variable
data
field, preceding any subfield
code (delimiter plus data element identifier) which may be present.  Each indicator
is
one character and every data field
in the record
includes two
indicators, even if values have not been defined for the indicators in a particular
field.  Indicators
supply
additional information about the field, and are defined individually for each field. 
Indicator values
are
interpreted independently; meaning is not ascribed to the two indicators taken
together. 
Indicators
may be any
ASCII lowercase alphabetic, numeric, or blank. A blank is used in an undefined indicator
position, and may also have a defined meaning in a defined indicator position.  The
numeric
character 9 is reserved for local
definition
as an
indicator.</p>
<p><strong> Subfield codes </strong> identify the individual data elements within
the
field, and precede the data
elements they
identify.  Each data field contains at least one subfield code.  The subfield code
consists of a
delimiter (ASCII 1F (hex)) followed by a data element identifier.  Data element identifiers
defined in
MARC 21 may be
any
ASCII
lowercase alphabetic or numeric character.  In general, numeric identifiers are
defined for data
used
to process
the field, or coded data needed to interpret the field.  Alphabetic identifiers are
defined for the
separate elements
which constitute the data content of the field.  The character 9 and the following
ASCII graphic
symbols are
reserved for local definition as data element identifiers:</p>
<pre> ! " # $ % & ' ( ) * + , - . / : ; &lt; = &gt; ? { } _ ^ ` ~ [ ] \  
</pre>

<p>A data field may contain more than one data element, depending upon the
definition of the
field. 
The last
character in a data field is the <strong> field terminator, </strong> which
follows the last
data element in the
field.</p>

<h4>DESIGN PRINCIPLES FOR MARC 21</h4>
<p>A MARC 21 format is a set of codes and content designators defined for encoding a
particular
type of
machine-readable record.  The MARC 21 formats as a group serve as a vehicle for
authority,
bibliographic,
classification, community information, and holdings data of all types.  These
formats are intended
to
be
communication formats and are primarily designed to provide specifications for the
exchange of
information
between systems.  The following description of design principles repeats, in some
cases,
information
given
above but is given again for completeness.</p>
<h4><a name="content">Content Designation</a></h4>
<p>The purpose of content designation is to identify and characterize the data
elements which
comprise a
MARC record with sufficient precision to support manipulation of the data for a
variety of
functions. The
MARC 21 formats have attempted to preserve consistency of content designation across
formats
where this
is appropriate.</p>
<p>The MARC 21 content designation supports the sorting of data only to a limited
extent. 
In
general,
sorting
must be
accomplished through the application of external algorithms to the data.</p>
<p>The MARC 21 formats provide for using content designation, e.g., tag values or
indicators,
to
specify recommended display constants.  A display constant is a term, phrase, and/or
spacing or
punctuation convention
that
may
be system generated under prescribed circumstances to make a visual presentation of
data in a
record
more
meaningful to a user.  The display constant text is not carried in the data, but may
be supplied for
display by
the processing system.</p>
<h4><a name="varitags">Variable Fields and Tags</a></h4>
<p>The data in a MARC 21 record is organized into fields, each identified by a
three-character
tag. 
Although ANSI Z39.2 and ISO 2709 allow both alphabetic and numeric characters,
MARC 21
formats
use only
numeric
tags.  The tag is stored in the directory entry for the field, not in the field
itself.  Variable field tags are
defined in blocks according to the first character of the tag, which, with some
exceptions, identifies the general function of
the field's data within a record.  The type of information in the field is
identified
by the
remainder of the
tag. 
The
meaning of these blocks depends upon the type of record.</p>
<p>The bibliographic format blocks are:</p>
<ul>
<li>0XX - Control information, numbers, and codes</li>
<li>1XX - Main entry</li>
<li>2XX - Titles and title paragraph (title, edition, imprint)</li>
<li>3XX - Physical description, etc.</li>
<li>4XX - Series statements</li>
<li>5XX - Notes</li>
<li>6XX - Subject access fields</li>
<li>7XX - Added entries other than subject or series; linking fields</li>
<li>8XX - Series added entries; location, and alternate graphics</li>
<li>9XX - Reserved for local implementation</li>
</ul>
<p>The authority format blocks are:</p>
<ul>
<li>0XX - Control information, numbers, and codes</li>
<li>1XX - Heading</li>
<li>2XX - Complex see references</li>
<li>3XX - Complex see also references</li>
<li>4XX - See from tracings</li>
<li>5XX - See also from tracings</li>
<li>6XX - Reference notes, treatment decisions, notes, etc.</li>
<li>7XX - Heading linking entries</li>
<li>8XX - Location and alternate graphics</li>
<li>9XX - Reserved for local implementation</li>
</ul>
<p>The classification format blocks are:</p>
<ul>
<li>0XX - Control information, numbers, and codes</li>
<li>1XX - Classification numbers and terms</li>
<li>2XX - Complex see references</li>
<li>3XX - Complex see also references</li>
<li>4XX - Invalid number tracings</li>
<li>5XX - Valid number tracings</li>
<li>6XX - Note fields</li>
<li>70X-75X - Index term fields</li>
<li>76X - Number building fields</li>
<li>8XX - Location and alternate graphics</li>
<li>9XX - Reserved for local implementation</li>
</ul>
<p>The community information format blocks are:</p>
<ul>
<li>0XX - Control information, numbers, and codes</li>
<li>1XX - Primary names</li>
<li>2XX - Titles, addresses</li>
<li>3XX - Physical information, etc.</li>
<li>4XX - Series information</li>
<li>5XX - Notes</li>
<li>6XX - Subject access fields</li>
<li>7XX - Added entries other than subject</li>
<li>8XX - Location and alternate graphics</li>
<li>9XX - Reserved for local implementation</li>
</ul>
<p>The holdings format blocks are:</p>
<ul>
<li>0XX - Control information, numbers, and codes <br>
<li>1XX - Not defined</li>
<li>2XX - Not defined</li>
<li>3XX - Not defined</li>
<li>4XX - Not defined</li>
<li>5XX - Notes</li>
<li>6XX - Not defined</li>
<li>7XX - Not defined</li>
<li>8XX - Holdings and location data, notes</li>
<li>9XX - Reserved for local implementation</li>
</ul>
<p>Within some blocks of variable fields, parallels of content designation are
preserved, e.g., bibliographic records (1XX, 4XX, 6XX, 7XX, 8XX), authority records
(1XX, 4XX, 5XX, 7XX), classification records (70X-75X), and community information
records (1XX, 4XX, 6XX, 7XX).  The
following meanings are generally given to the final two characters of the tag of
fields
in these blocks:</p>
<ul>
<li>X00 - Personal names</li>
<li>X10 - Corporate names</li>
<li>X11 - Meeting names</li>
<li>X30 - Uniform titles</li>
<li>X40 - Bibliographic titles</li>
<li>X50 - Topical terms</li>
<li>X51 - Geographic names</li>
<li>X55 - Genre/form terms</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="note">Note Fields</a></h4>
<p>Rules have been developed for the MARC 21 formats that guide when a separate field
should be defined for note
data and
when
the data
should be included in a general note field.  For the MARC 21 bibliographic format, a
specific 5XX
note field
is defined when at least one of the following is true:</p>
<ol>
<li>Categorical indexing or retrieval is required on the data defined for the
note.  The note is
used for
  structured access purposes but does not have the nature of a controlled access
point.</li>
<li>Special manipulation of that specific category of data is a routine
requirement.  Such
manipulation
  includes special print or display formatting or selection or suppression from
display or printed
  product.</li>
<li>Specialized structuring of information for reasons other than those given
above, e.g., to
support
  particular standards of data content when they cannot be supported in existing
fields.</li>
</ol>

<p>For the MARC 21 authority format, the specifications for notes are covered in the
following
two
conditions:</p>

<ol>
<li>A specific note field is needed when special manipulation of that specific
category of data
is a
  routine requirement.  Such manipulation includes special print or display
formatting or
selection
  or suppression from display or printed product.</li>
<li>Multiple notes are generally not established to accommodate the same type of
information
for
  different types of authorities.  Notes are thus not differentiated by or limited
to subject, name,
or
  series if the same information applies to more than one type.</li>
  </ol>
  
<h4><a name="local">Local Fields</a></h4>
<p>Certain tags have been reserved for local implementation.  The MARC 21 formats specify
no structure or meaning for local fields.  Communication
of such fields between systems is governed by mutual agreements on the content and content
designation of the fields
communicated.</p>
<p>In general, any tag containing the character 9 is reserved for local implementation within
the block structure.  Specifically the 9XX block is reserved for local implementation as indicated
above.  The historical development of the MARC 21 formats has left one exception to this
general principle: field 490 (Series Statement) in the bibliographic format.  There are several
obsolete fields with tags containing the
character 9 (e.g., 009 (Physical Description Fixed-Field for Archival Collection) and 039 (Level
of Bibliographic Control and Coding Detail)).  The indicator value 9 and subfield 9 are also
reserved for local implementation.</p>
<h4><a name="repeat">Repeatability</a></h4>
<p>Theoretically, all fields, except 001 (Control Number) and 005 (Date and Time of
Latest Transaction), and subfields may be repeated.  The nature of the data, however, often
precludes repetition (e.g., a bibliographic or community information record may contain only
one field 245 (Title Statement); an authority or classification record may contain only one 1XX
heading field).  The repeatability or nonrepeatability of each
field and subfield is specified in the MARC 21 formats.</p>
<h4><a name="code">Coded Data</a></h4>
<p>In addition to content designation, the MARC 21 formats include specifications for
the content of certain data elements, particularly those that provide for the representation of data
by coded values.  Coded values consist of fixed-length ASCII character strings.  Individual
elements within a coded-data field or subfield are identified by relative character position. 
Although coded data occur most frequently in the leader, directory, and variable control fields,
any field or subfield may be defined for coded data.</p>
<p>Certain common values for codes used in coded data have been defined:</p>
<dl compact>
<dt>
<strong> blank (ASCII 20 (hex)) </strong></dt>
<dd>
Undefined (element not
defined)</dd>
<dt>
<strong>  n </strong></dt>
<dd>
Not applicable (element not applicable
to
the item)</dd>
<dt>
<strong> u </strong></dt>
<dd>
Unknown (record creator was unable to determine value)</dd>
<dt>
<strong> z </strong></dt>
<dd>
Other (value other than those defined for the element)</dd>
<dt>
<strong> | </strong></dt>
<dd>
Fill character (record creator has chosen not to provide information)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Historical exceptions to these definitions may occur in the formats.  In particular,
the blank has been defined as <em>not applicable,</em> or has been assigned a
meaning.</p>
