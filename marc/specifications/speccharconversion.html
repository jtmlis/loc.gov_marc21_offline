<h4><a name="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h4>
<p>The foregoing parts have described the two encoding options, MARC-8 and Unicode,
  specified for use in MARC 21 records. There are many situations in which it
  may be necessary or desirable to convert records from one of these schemes
  to the other. This section identifies a number of factors a successful conversion
  must take into account and specifies techniques for converting Unicode records
  that contain characters absent from the MARC-8 repertoire.</p>
<p>On this site, <a href="specchartables.html">Part 5: MARC-8 Code Tables</a> contains
  tables showing the MARC-8 repertoire along with the code values of each character
  in MARC-8 and Unicode schemes. It also contains links to an XML version of
  the table for all MARC-8 characters, and a comma-delimited file of MARC-8/Unicode
  correspondences for the EACC (CJK) character set only. </p>
<hr>
<h4><a name="genissues">GENERAL CONVERSION ISSUES</a></h4>
<p>The following points need to be considered when converting from either specified
  encoding to the other.</p>
<h5><a name="encoding">MARC 21 encoding marker</a></h5>
<p>When converting from MARC-8 to Unicode, <a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/ecbdldrd.html#mrcblea">Leader</a> position
  9 (Character encoding scheme) must be set to "a" to indicate that the converted
  record uses Unicode encoding. When converting from Unicode to MARC-8 Unicode,
  Leader position 9 must be set to "blank" (20(hex)).</p>
<h5><a name="escape">Escape sequences and MARC field 066</a></h5>
<p>Neither field <a href="../bibliographic/ecbdclas.html#mrcb066">066</a> (Character
  Sets Present) nor any escape sequence is allowed in a Unicode MARC 21 environment.
  Escape sequences and the <a href="../bibliographic/ecbdclas.html#mrcb066">066</a> field
  in a MARC-8-encoded record must be removed during conversion to Unicode.</p>
<p>When converting to MARC-8, escape sequences and a <a href="../bibliographic/ecbdclas.html#mrcb066">066</a> field
  must be constructed where appropriate. Field <a href="../bibliographic/ecbdclas.html#mrcb066">066</a> is
  required in a MARC-8-encoded record whenever it contains a type 2 escape sequence,
  as described above in <a href="speccharmarc8.html">Part 2</a>. If there are
  no such escapes, field <a href="../bibliographic/ecbdclas.html#mrcb066">066</a> is
  not used.</p>
<h5><a name="subfield6">MARC subfield $6 (Linkage)</a></h5>
<p><a href="../bibliographic/ecbdcntf.html#mrcs6">Subfield
    $6</a> (Linkage) is used in MARC 21 records to link alternate graphic representations
    of the same data, to identify the presence of specific scripts in a field,
    and to flag fields in which the display/print directionality of data is right-to-left
    (e.g., for Arabic script). The <a href="../bibliographic/ecbdcntf.html#mrcs6">subfield
    $6</a> script identification code in MARC-8-encoded MARC 21 records identifies
    MARC-8 character sets, rather than scripts <em>per se</em>; hence the code
    is irrelevant in the Unicode environment because the character set is always
    UCS. The script identification code should be dropped from <a href="../bibliographic/ecbdcntf.html#mrcs6">subfield
    $6</a> when converting from MARC-8 to Unicode encoding. The field orientation
    code, which flags a field as having right-to-left display directionality,
    should be used in Unicode-encoded MARC 21 records. When present, the script
    identification code is separated from the <a href="../bibliographic/ecbdcntf.html#mrcs6">subfield
    $6</a> linking tag and occurrence number by two solidus (slash) characters
    (002F(hex)). In conversion from Unicode to MARC-8, the script identification
    code should be restored, typically to a code recorded in subfield $c of the <a href="../bibliographic/ecbdclas.html#mrcb066">066</a> field.</p>
<h5><a name="combining">Combining characters (diacritics)</a></h5>
<p>In moving from MARC-8 to Unicode it is necessary to re-order combining characters
  and base characters so that the base character precedes the combining character(s).
  When converting from Unicode to MARC-8, combining marks must be moved to precede
  the base characters. The differing rules for proper sequencing of combining
  marks when a base letter has more than one are specified in <a href="speccharucs.html">Part
  3</a> (i.e.top down vs. inside out.) Best practice during conversion is to
  reorder the multiple marks according to the rule for the output encoding, but
  this is not considered mandatory.</p>
<h5><a name="directionality">Directionality of text</a></h5>
<p>When converting from MARC-8 to Unicode, the conversion should determine whether
  multi-digit numbers used in bidirectional scripts have been entered in logical
  or visual order. If visual order has been used, best practice requires that
  the digits be re-ordered from visual order to logical order. If logical order
  has been used, no re-ordering is necessary.</p>
<h5><a name="folding">Folding of certain MARC-8 Codes</a></h5>
<p>The numbers, punctuation marks, and symbols found in ASCII 21-3F, 5B, 5D (hex)
  are also, in full or in part, allocated code points in the MARC-8 sets for
  Hebrew, Cyrillic, and Arabic. These are mapped (folded) into a single, identical
  set of Unicode code points, as specified in the mappings in the code tables
  in <a href="specchartables.html">Part 5</a>; hence mappings are not perfectly
  reversible because these characters will always be mapped to the ASCII set
  during reconversion to MARC-8. The resultant record may contain more escape
  sequences than the same record originally encoded in MARC-8 required. This
  is an acceptable result that should not interfere with processing or display
  of the record.</p>
<p>The characters (alpha, beta, gamma) of the custom MARC-8 Greek Symbols set
  are mapped to the regular Greek letters in Unicode and consequently are not
  reversible when reconverting to MARC-8. Use of the Greek Symbols set is strongly
  discouraged for that reason. In MARC-8 contexts where escapes to the standard
  Basic Greek set is not feasible, textual equivalents of the symbols should
  be preferred i.e., [alpha], [beta], [gamma] over use of the Greek Symbol set.</p>
<p>The space character (20 (hex)) is defined only in the Unicode and ASCII sets
  but is recognized by all the standard graphic character sets in MARC-8 even
  though not included in those sets. When converting from Unicode to MARC-8,
  the space character can be converted (unchanged) without being preceded by
  an escape sequence no matter which of the standard sets is the current working
  set. Optionally, the escape sequence to ASCII may be included before the space
  character. However, when the output working set is a custom set accessed by
  escape technique 1, the technique 1 escape sequence to ASCII is required before
  the space character.</p>
<hr>
<h4><a name="specissues">ISSUES SPECIFIC TO CONVERTING UNICODE TO MARC-8</a></h4>
<p>The <a href="speccharmarc8.html">MARC-8 repertoire</a> contains over 16,000
  characters; the <a href="http://www.unicode.org">Unicode repertoire</a> contains
  over 100,000 characters. Direct mappings using the tables in <a href="specchartables.html">Part
  5</a> are sufficient for Unicode to MARC-8 conversion only for a record that
  contains no characters that are outside the MARC-8 repertoire. Additional techniques
  are needed for the more general case in which non-MARC-8 characters may be
  present in a Unicode record that is to be converted.</p>
<p>Two generally applicable methods for conversion from Unicode to MARC-8 encoding
  have been approved to aid conversion of MARC 21 records containing characters
  outside the MARC-8 repertoire. The two methods must not be used in the same
  record.</p>
<h5><a name="lossy">Lossy conversion to MARC-8 encoding</a></h5>
<p>The lossy conversion method is intended for use in situations in which the
  loss of data beyond the large MARC-8 repertoire is not a concern. Each character
  that is not in the MARC-8 repertoire is replaced with an ASCII vertical bar
  (7C(hex)) during conversion. This method is called lossy because the substitution
  of a generic placeholder for every unconvertible Unicode code point loses data
  that cannot be recovered in a reconversion to Unicode.</p>
<h5><a name="lossless">Lossless conversion to MARC-8 encoding</a></h5>
<p>In the lossless conversion method, a Unicode character that is not in the
  MARC-8 repertoire is replaced by a hexadecimal Numeric Character Reference
  (NCR) identifying the specific unconvertable Unicode code point. This method
  preserved precisely the information content of the Unicode record although
  the result may result in a cryptic display, and additional conversion techniques
  will be required to reconstruct the record exactly in Unicode. The Numeric
  Character Reference consists only of ASCII characters, thus can be carried
  into the MARC-8 target record.</p>
<p>The structure of the NCR is <strong>&amp;#xXXXX;</strong> where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&amp; and ; (the ampersand and semicolon) surround the Reference data </li>
  <li>#x designates that the value expressed is in hexadecimal notation</li>
  <li>XXXX is the hexadecimal representation of the <em>code point</em> for the
    Unicode character expressed in hex digits 0123456789ABCDEF. Some characters,
    primarily infrequently encountered CJK ideographs, may require more than
    four hexadecimal digits. The NCR can contain more than four digits if they
    are needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is not correct to represent a non-ASCII character in an NCR by its UTF-8
  octets; only the <em>scalar value</em> of the code point is allowed.</p>
<h5><a name="enhancingunicode">Enhancing the Unicode to MARC-8 conversion</a></h5>
<p>Either the lossy or the lossless conversion method can be applied directly
  to a Unicode record, but better results will be obtained if characters outside
  the MARC-8 repertoire are first converted, as far as possible, into approximately
  equivalent MARC-8 characters or character sequences. This will minimize the
  number of vertical bars or NCRs in the output and a more readily usable output
  record will result. Techniques of this sort are frequently referred to as normalization.
  Unicode defines four normalization forms for use within the Unicode environment.
  The optimal normalization for conversion to MARC-8 is a variant of the one
  called Compatibility Decomposition, or KD.</p>
<p>The code charts on the Unicode web site list valid decomposition sequences
  for all decomposable characters. These sequences are of two kinds: <em>canonical</em> and <em>compatibility</em>.
  A common example of the <em>canonical</em> type is the decomposition of a letter
  with a diacritical mark: E with acute accent (00E9(hex)) decomposes to E (0045(hex))
  + acute (0301(hex)). <em>Compatibility</em> decompositions differ from the
  canonical in that they &quot;do not attempt to retain or emulate the formatting
  of the original character.&quot; (Unicode Standard 5.0, Section 17.1). Some examples
  of characters with <em>compatibility</em> equivalents are the ellipsis character
  (2026(hex)) that decomposes to a sequence of three periods (002E(hex)); the
  circled digit four (2463(hex)) that becomes simply 4 (0043(hex)); the Roman
  numeral IV (2163(hex)) that decomposes to I (0049(hex)) + V (0056(hex)); and
  any of the spaces of different width (2000-2008(hex)) that can decompose in
  one or two steps to the ASCII space (0020(hex)).</p>
<p>Unicode normalization form D specifies only <em>canonical</em> decompositions.
  MARC-8 repertoire includes several precomposed characters that can be decomposed
  in Unicode, but should not be decomposed during conversion to MARC-8. These
  characters are specified in Table 4.1 below.</p>

</table>
<p>Unicode normalization form KD, the optimal for conversion from Unicode to
  MARC-8 repertoires, specifies that decompositions of both types, <em>canonical</em> and <em>compatibility</em>,
  should be done until no further decomposition is possible. The full KD normalization,
  however, may not be desired because of the <em>canonical</em> decompositions
  in the above table and other issues with the <em>compatibility</em> decompositions,
  such as loss of formatting with superscripts and subscripts. </p>
<h5><a name="considerations">Additional considerations for converting characters
    with combining marks</a></h5>
<p>A further complication arises when a character with a combining mark cannot
  be normalized into components belonging to the MARC-8 repertoire. Proper treatment
  depends on whether it is the base character or the combining mark that is absent
  from the repertoire. If the base character can be converted, then the combining
  mark should be replaced by an NCR or placeholder properly repositioned before
  the base character in the output record. If the base character cannot be converted,
  either the lossless or the lossy technique can be applied directly, preferably
  to the character in its precomposed form, so that it will generate a single
  NCR or placeholder rather than two. This treatment is preferred whether or
  not the combining character is also missing from the MARC-8 repertoire.</p>
