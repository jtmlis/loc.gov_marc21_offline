<h4><a name="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h4>

<p>The diskette formatting and labeling specifications used in the distribution of

MARC 21 authority, bibliographic, classification, community information, and holdings records
on diskette are described below. These diskette label specifications were provisionally approved
by the Library of Congress, the MARC 21 Advisory Committee in November 1990 and by the
Canadian Committee on MARC in June 1991.  The specifications apply to internal diskette
labels only.</p>

<p>Microcomputer diskette volume and file labels, like tape labels, communicate

information from the originating system to the receiving system.  The volume and file labels
identify and characterize the diskette(s), the transaction, and the information contained on the
microcomputer diskette(s). The volume and file labels provide an eye-readable display of
identifying information and also enable machine processing of the information.</p>



<h4><a name="format">DISKETTE FORMAT</a></h4>

<p>A MARC 21 microcomputer diskette for information interchange is a magnetic

diskette (e.g.,3.5 inch microdisc) that contains label files and at least one

file of MARC

records.</p>





<h4><a name="fileorg">DISKETTE FILE ORGANIZATION</a></h4>

<p>Files may be organized for a transaction in one of three ways: 1) single volume,

single file; 2)

single volume, multiple files; and 3) multiple volumes, multiple files.  Each

single diskette

constitutes

one volume.  Record blocking is not used and individual records do not span files

or volumes. 

Files

do not span volumes.  Large logical files of records can be segmented into multiple

physical files

on

separate volumes.  The following configurations may be used.  NOTE: The names in

parentheses

are

required filenames.  The notation nnn represents sequential numbers determined by

the originator of the volume(s)/file(s).</p>





<pre><B>Single volume, Single file     Single volume, Multiple files</B>

   Volume Label File (VOL.nnn)    Volume Label File (VOL.nnn)
   File Label File (FIL.nnn)      File Label File (FIL.nnn)
   Bibliographic File             Bibliographic File 
                                  File Label File (FIL.nnn)
                                  Bibliographic File
</pre>

<pre><B>Multiple volumes, Multiple files</B>

          Volume A                       Volume B 
        
   Volume Label File (VOL.nnn)    Volume Label File (VOL.nnn)
   File Label File (FIL.nnn)      File Label File (FIL.nnn)

   File Label File (FIL.nnn)      File Label File (FIL.nnn)
   Bibliographic File             Bibliographic File
</pre>

<h4><a name="labfile">DISKETTE LABEL FILES</a></h4>

<p>MARC 21 Microcomputer diskettes contain label files that identify and characterize
the volume(s) and the file(s) of MARC 21 records.  The label files are used to transfer
non-MARC information between an originating system and a receiving system.  The label files
are written using only ASCII Latin characters.  A <em> volume label</em> file is required
for each new physical volume (i.e., each diskette).  A <em> file label</em> file is required
for each named file of MARC 21 records. </p>

<p>Diskettes should also bear an external eye-readable label which lists the Originating System ID
(ORS), the Volume ID (VID), and the Date Volume(s) Compiled (DAT).</p>



<h4><a name="filename">DISKETTE FILE NAMES</a></h4>

<p>File names for label files must accommodate dissimilar operating systems, such as
Windows, PC-DOS, MS-DOS, APPLE-DOS and Macintosh environments.  While certain
operating systems have

more

flexible naming conventions than others, label files are named according to DOS

filename

conventions

that specify filenames of 1-to-8 characters and a 1-to-3 character extension. 

Alphabetic

characters

in filenames and extensions shall be in uppercase.</p>

<p>Volume label files are named "VOL.nnn" (nnn are numerics designating the volumes,

e.g.,

VOL.001, VOL.002).  The 3-digit numeric extensions in the filename are assigned in a

sequential

order, and the highest number in the extension will equal the total number of

volumes in a

transaction.</p>

<p>File label files are named "FIL.nnn" (nnn are numerics designating the files,

e.g.,

FIL.001).</p>

<p>Record files are named according to DOS naming conventions that allow names of

1-8

characters

in length, a 1-3 character extension, etc. (e.g., SERMARC.nnn).  The 3-digit numeric

filename

extension of the bibliographic file will match the 3-digit numeric filename

extension of the file

label

with which it is associated. </p>



<h4><a name="filestruc">LABEL FILE STRUCTURE</a></h4>

<p>A label file consists of a sequence of fields.  Fields have a maximum length of

80 characters. 

Each field in a label file begins with a three-character tag identifying the field. 

The tag is followed

by two blanks (ASCII character 20(hex)).  The field's data content follows the two

blanks.  Each

field

ends with a number sign "#" (ASCII character 23(hex)) and a carriage return (ASCII

character

0D(hex))

or carriage return/line feed (ASCII characters 0D(hex) 0A(hex)), dependent on

operating

systems and

subject to the agreement between originating and receiving systems.  The 80

character maximum

length of the field includes the three character tag, the two blanks, the data

content, the number

sign,

and the carriage return or carriage return/line feed.  This results in a text string

that is easily

displayed

on a monitor or printed out.</p>

<p>Certain fields in the label files are specified as mandatory and must be present

in each label

file. 

In these fields, data content or one fill character the vertical bar (| - ASCII

character

7C(hex)),

must

be

supplied.  Mandatory or optional characteristics of the fields are noted below. </p>

<p>Several of the fields are repeatable when either of the following two conditions

exist: 1) the

data

content exceeds the space available in the field (73 characters between the blank

space and

number

sign);  or, 2) for eye readability, the sections of the data are moved to a new

line.  In each case,

the

three-character tag and two blank spaces are repeated.</p>



<h4><a name="volume">DISKETTE VOLUME LABELS -- Tags/Fields</a></h4>

<p>The following order of the fields in the volume label is mandatory whether or not

all fields are

present.</p>

<h4><a name="direct">DISKETTE DIRECTORY DISPLAY</a></h4>

<p>The MARC 21 diskette volume and file label files are designed to allow the

determination of

the

content of a diskette by listing its directory using the DOS "dir" command (or

similar command in

other system environments).  Below is an example of the directory listing for a

typical diskette

containing files of MARC 21 records.  In this example, the diskette contains three

files of

bibliographic records.</p>

<p><em>Example:</em>

<pre>      A:&gt; dir

      Volume in drive A is 001
      Directory of A:\

      VOL.001
      FIL.001
      BOOKMARC.001
      FIL.002
      SERMARC.002
      FIL.003
      VMMARC.003
</pre>



<p>Since the data and files on microcomputer diskettes are usually accessed in

random order, the

sequence of the various files listed in the directory does not matter.  The example

above has

ordered

the files so as to show the correspondence between the file label files and the

bibliographic

files.</p>
