<h4><a name="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h4>  
<p>The use of an exchange medium (e.g., electronic, diskette, tape) is an integral part of
sharing files of MARC 21  records.  This section includes media format and labeling
specifications for electronic file transfer (Part 1), microcomputer diskettes (Part 2), and magnetic
tape (Parts 3 and 4) which are being used to exchange MARC 21  data.  The specifications vary
slightly for each medium to allow better utilization of the technology involved.  Adherence to
media format and labeling specifications is essential for successful exchange of MARC 21 
records.</p>  
  
<h4><a name="define">DEFINITIONS</a></h4>
<p>The following terms with these specialized definitions are used in the exchange media
specifications.   
<p> 
<em>Italicized terms within definitions are terms for which definitions are also
provided.</em> </p> 
<dl compact>  
<dt>  
<strong> bibliographic file. </strong></dt>  
<dd>  
A <em>file</em> on the exchange  
medium  
(e.g., <em>diskette</em>) that contains  
MARC  
records.  When generally used, the term can refer to MARC records containing  
authority,  
bibliographic, classification, community information, and holdings data.</dd>  
<dt>  
<strong> blank. </strong></dt>  
<dd>  
ASCII character 20(hex).  Also referred to as the space character.</dd>  
<dt>  
<strong> block. </strong></dt>  
<dd>  
A collection of contiguously  
recorded  
characters written or read  
as  
a unit.  Blocks are separated by an <em>interblock gap</em>.  A block  
may  
contain  
one or more complete <em>records</em>, or it may contain segments of  
one or  
more  
<em>segmented records</em>.  A block does not contain multiple segments  
of the  
same record.</dd>  
<dt>  
<strong> blocked record. </strong></dt>  
<dd>  
A <em>record</em> contained in a  
<em>file</em> in which each <em>block</em> may contain more than  
one  
record or <em>record segment</em>.</dd>  
<dt>  
<strong> data element. </strong></dt>  
<dd>  
A defined unit of  
information. 
<dt> 
<strong>diskette.</strong> </dt>  
<dd> 
A physical exchange medium usually composed of a thin disk with a magnetic surface on both
sides, enclosed in protective case.  A variety of diskette sizes exist, 5.25 inches or 3.5 inches
in diameter being the most common.  Hardware to read from and write to such diskettes usually
support various densities of encoded data.</dd>  
<dt>  
<strong> field. </strong></dt>  
<dd>  
A defined character string that  
may  
contain one or more <em>data elements</em>.</dd>  
<dt>  
<strong> file. </strong></dt>  
<dd>  
A set of related <em>records</em> treated as a unit.   
A file may form part of a physical or logical <em>volume</em>.</dd>  
<dt>  
<strong> file section. </strong></dt>  
<dd>  
That part of a <em>file</em> that is recorded  
on any one <em>volume</em>.  The sections of a file do not have sections of other files 
interspersed.</dd>  
<dt>  
<strong> file transfer protocol (FTP). </strong></dt>  
<dd>  
A standard  
technique and syntax for  
communicating machine-readable data electronically in separate files without losing  
data or file  
integrity.</dd>  
<dt>  
<strong> interblock gap. </strong></dt>  
<dd>  
A magnetically-erased  
section  
of tape separating <em>blocks</em> of information.</dd>  
<dt>  
<strong> label. </strong></dt>  
<dd>  
A <em>record</em> at  
the beginning of a <em>volume</em>, and at the beginning and end of a <em>file  
section</em>,  
that identifies and characterizes that volume and file section.  A label is not  
considered to be part  
of  
a file section.  A label is identified by a three letter Label Identifier followed  
by a single character,  
the  
Label Number.  Each label is recorded in a separate <em>block</em>.</dd>  
<dt>  
<strong> label file. </strong></dt>  
<dd>  
<em>File</em> on  
an exchange medium that  
identifies and characterizes the content of the <em>file(s)</em> and/or  
<em>volume(s)</em>.</dd>  
<dt>  
<strong> label group. </strong></dt>  
<dd>  
One or more contiguous <em>label  
sets</em>.</dd>  
<dt>  
<strong> label set. </strong></dt>  
<dd>  
One or more contiguous <em>labels</em> with  
the same three initial characters (Label Identifier).</dd>  
<dt>  
<strong> originating system. </strong></dt>  
<dd>  
An information  
processing system that writes <em>files</em> of MARC records for the purpose of data
interchange with a  
<em>receiving system</em>.</dd>  
<dt>  
<strong> receiving system. </strong></dt>  
<dd>  
An information  
processing  
system that is intended to  
read  
<em>files</em> of MARC records that have been processed by an <em>originating
system</em> for the purpose of data interchange.</dd>  
<dt>  
<strong> record. </strong></dt>  
<dd>  
Related pieces of data treated as  
a  
unit.</dd>  
<dt>  
<strong> record segment. </strong></dt>  
<dd>  
That part of a <em>segmented  
record</em>  
that is contained in any one <em>block</em>.  The segments of a record do not have
segments  
of other  
records  
interspersed.</dd>  
<dt>  
<strong> segment control word (SCW). </strong></dt>  
<dd>  
A  
fixed-length  
string used to indicate the  
type and content of a segment in a <em>file</em> of <em>segmented  
records</em>.</dd>  
<dt>  
<strong> segmented record. </strong></dt>  
<dd>  
A <em>record</em> contained in a  
<em>file</em> in which each record consists of a sequence of one or  
more <em>record segments</em>.  Records are contained in one or more consecutive  
<em>blocks</em>, such that only one segment of each record can appear in any  
one  
block.</dd>  
<dt>  
<strong> tape. </strong></dt>  
<dd>  
A physical exchange medium usually  
composed of a thin acetate  
film  
in a variety of widths (2-inch (5.08cm), 1-inch (2.54cm), and 1/2-inch (1.27cm) tape  
are the most  
common).  The acetate film can be housed on reels or in cartridges.</dd>  
<dt>  
<strong> tape mark. </strong></dt>  
<dd>  
A special control block  
recorded  
on magnetic tape to serve  
as  
a separator between <em> file sections</em> and <em>label  
groups</em> and also between certain label groups.</dd>  
<dt>  
<strong> transaction. </strong></dt>  
<dd>  
A single operation in which  
a  
<em>volume</em>  
or set of volumes of MARC <em>file(s)</em> is transferred from an <em>originating
system</em> to a <em>receiving  
system</em>.</dd>  
<dt>  
<strong> volume. </strong></dt>  
<dd>  
A physical or logical unit which  
includes part of a <em>file</em>, a complete file, or more than one file.  For separate  
(dismountable) media  
(e.g., a reel of magnetic tape), a volume is usually a single physical unit.  A  
volume contains  
<em>label file(s)</em> and one or more <em>bibliographic  
file(s)</em>.  It  
may contain sections of files but does not contain multiple sections of the same  
file.</dd>
