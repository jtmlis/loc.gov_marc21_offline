<h4><a name="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h4>

<p>The specifications for transferring files of MARC 21 records
electronically assume the use of a standard protocol.  The File
Transfer Protocol (FTP) is the most generally used.  FTP can be
used in place of a physical exchange medium to move MARC 21
authority, bibliographic, classification, community information,
and holdings records from a storage device in an originating system
to a receiving system.  These electronic file transfer
specifications were approved by the Library of Congress and the
MARC 21 Advisory Committee in June 1993, and by the Canadian Committee on MARC in
October 1993.</p>
<p>The labels used with electronic file transfer, like tape and
diskette volume and file labels, communicate information from the
originating system to the receiving system.  The labels identify
and characterize the transaction and the information contained in
the data that is being transferred electronically.  The labels will
make possible an eye-readable display of the identifying
information and also enable machine processing of the
information.</p>

<h4><a name="file">ELECTRONIC TRANSFER FILE ORGANIZATION</a></h4> 

<p>Each file of MARC 21 records should be accompanied by a companion
label file containing bibliographic file and volume information. 
The label and record file pair can be transferred separately or
they can be compressed (archived) into a single file for transfer
by the originating system.  It is then up to the receiving system
to decompress (restore) the label and record file(s).  The concept
of physical <em>volumes</em> does not apply to electronic transfers
as it does to exchange using dismountable physical media, but the
identification of volumes may be particularly useful with groups of
files compressed for transfer into a single file.  Record blocking
is <em>not</em> used and individual records do not span files or
transfers.  Large logical files of records can be segmented into
multiple physical files during separate transfers.  The following
configurations may be used.</p>
<pre> 
  <B>Uncompressed transfer              Compressed transfer</B> 
 
  Label File                         Compressed File 
  Bibliographic File                      Label File 1 
                                          Bibliographic File 1 
                                          Label File <em>n</em> 
                                          Bibliographic File <em>n</em> 
</pre> 
 


<h4><a name="label">ELECTRONIC TRANSFER LABEL FILES</a></h4>
<p>A file of MARC 21 records is transferred electronically following
a label file that identifies and characterizes the file of MARC 21
records, and optionally, the volume to which it belongs.  
<strong>NOTE:</strong> Volume information is <em>not</em>
transmitted in a separate file as is done with tape and diskette. 
The label file is used to transfer non-MARC information between an
originating system and a receiving system.  The label file is
written using only ASCII Latin characters.  A <em>label
file</em> is required for each file of MARC 21 records
transmitted.</p>

<h4><a name="fname">ELECTRONIC TRANSFER FILE NAMES</a></h4>
<p>These MARC 21 specifications do not mandate the length or style
of file names due to differences between operating systems. 
Exchange partners should agree upon file naming conventions prior
to transferring MARC 21 records electronically.</p>
<h4><a name="labelstruc">ELECTRONIC TRANSFER LABEL FILE
STRUCTURE</a></h4>
<p>A label file consists of a sequence of fixed-length and variable
fields.  The order of fields should be the same as the list below. 
The length of fixed-length fields is specified in the descriptions
of those fields.  Variable length fields have no maximum length. 
Each field in a label file begins with a three-character tag
followed by two blanks (ASCII character 20 (hex)).  The
field's data content follows the two blanks.  Each field ends with
a carriage return (ASCII control character 0D (hex)) or a
carriage return/line feed pair (ASCII control characters 0D 0A (hex)) immediately
  following
the data in the field. 
The field terminator character (ASCII control character 1E (hex))
is no longer used.</p>
<p>Certain fields in the label files are specified as mandatory and
must be present in each label file. 
In these fields, data content or one fill character (the vertical
bar | (ASCII character 7C (hex)), must be supplied. 
Mandatory or optional characteristics of the fields are also noted
below.  Several of the fields are repeatable.</p>


<h4><a name="tagfield">ELECTRONIC TRANSFER FILE AND VOLUME LABELS
-- Tags/Fields</a></h4>
<p>The following order of the fields in the file label is mandatory
whether or not all fields are present.</p>

<dl>

<dt>DAT (Date compiled):</dt><dd>Mandatory; Fixed length; Not repeatable.  This
is the date the originating system completed the compilation of the file of
records.  This is not the date of the creation of the records contained in the
bibliographic file.  The field is recorded according to <em>Representation of Dates and Times
</em> (ISO 8601). The date requires 8 numeric characters in the pattern
<em>yyyymmdd</em> (4 for the year, 2 for the month, and 2 for the day; right
justified and zero filled).  The time requires 8 numeric characters in the
pattern <em>hhmmss.f</em> (2 for the hour, 2 for the minute, 2 for the
second, and 2 for a decimal fraction of the second, including the decimal point). 
The 24-hour clock (00-23) is used.</dd>

<dt>RBF (Number of records in file):</dt><dd>Mandatory; Variable length;
Non-repeatable.  This element includes the number of logical records contained
in the file of MARC 21 records.</dd>
<dt>DSN (Data Set Name):</dt><dd>Mandatory; Variable length; Not repeatable.  The 

filename of the file of MARC 21 records (which is sent separately) for which this
is a file label.</dd>

<dt>ORS (Originating system ID):</dt><dd>Mandatory; Variable length; Not
repeatable. The name of the system that compiled the files of records.  This
could be a symbol (e.g., OCLC) or text.</dd>

<dt>CID (Country identifier):</dt><dd>Optional; Fixed length; Not repeatable. 
The country identifier of the system that compiled the files of records.  The
identifier is taken from <em>Codes for representation of names of countries</em>
(ISO 3166).</dd>

<dt>DTS (Date sent):</dt><dd>Optional; Fixed length; Not repeatable.  This is the
date of transmission of the file of MARC 21 records.  The field is recorded
according to <em>Representation of Dates and Times</em> (ISO 8601).  The date requires
8 numeric characters in the pattern <em>yyyymmdd</em> (4 for the year, 2 for the
month, and 2 for the day; right justified and zero filled).  The time requires
8 numeric characters in the pattern <em>hhmmss.f</em> (2 for the hour,
2 for the minute, 2 for the second, and 2 for a decimal fraction of the second,
including the decimal point).  The 24-hour clock (00-23) is used.</dd>

<dt>DTR (Dates of records):</dt>
<dd>Optional; Fixed length; Not repeatable.  This
includes inclusive dates of last transaction of the records in the file, i.e.
  the first and last date recorded in the 005 fields of the file of records.
  The field
is recorded according to <em>Representation of Dates and Times</em> (ISO 8601).
The
date requires 16 numeric characters in the pattern <em>yyyymmddyyyymmdd</em> (4
for the year, 2 for the month, and 2 for the day for each date; right justified
and zero filled).</dd> 

<dt>FOR (Format):</dt><dd>Mandatory; Fixed length; Not repeatable.  This element
designates the format of the records, generally M for MARC.  Other codes may be
defined as needed (e.g., Z for Z39.2 for copyright records).</dd>

<dt>FQF (Format qualifier):</dt><dd>Optional; Variable length; Not repeatable. 
This element provides additional description of the format of the record file. 
For example, it may identify a particular tag set/specification for MARC records
or a particular DTD for SGML records.  For MARC formats, the content of the FQF
field may be text of a code from the list 
<a href="http://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency/defns/oids.html#5"><em>Z39.50
registered record syntaxes</em></a>.  For DTDs, the content is the identifier in
the DTD DOCTYPE element.</dd>

<dt>DES (Description of records):</dt><dd>Optional; Variable length; Repeatable. 
This element describes the records.  The data could be coded or describe a
product name.  (For example, OCLC uses B for Bibliographic describing a data
type; CDS may use a product name, such as MDS-Books All.)</dd>

<dt>CS0-n (Character set 0-n):</dt><dd>Optional; Variable length; Not repeatable. 
These fields specify the character sets (control and/or graphic) needed for
processing the record data file.  The field content is text indicating a
particular set (e.g., ISO 646-IRV, ISO Registration #37, MARC 21, or a reference
to a private character set).  CS0 indicates at least the G0 set and CS1-n
indicate other sets in the file.</dd>

<dt>CV0-n (Character variation 0-n):</dt><dd>Optional; Variable length;
Repeatable.  These fields are used in conjunction with the CS fields and contain
a textual description of the variations from the set specified in the
corresponding CSn field.  Variations noted in this field may be that the set: 1)
was not used strictly according to the standard; 2) has options for some
positions that need to be specified; or 3) has additional characters in positions
that are undefined in the standard.</dd>

<dt>VOL (Volume):</dt><dd>Optional; Variable length; Repeatable.  This may be
used if it is desirable to assign a volume number when distribution of records
is by subscription.  Each file within a subscription year may be given a volume
and issue number.</dd>

<dt>ISS (Issue):</dt><dd>Optional; Variable length; Repeatable.  This may be used
if it is desirable to assign a volume and issue number when distribution of
records is by subscription.  Each file within a subscription year may be given
a volume and issue number.  It may be combined with Volume (e.g., V1402).</dd>

<dt>FDI (Final destination ID):</dt><dd>Optional; Variable length; Not
repeatable.  This field would contain the name or identifier of the
final-destination database.</dd>

<dt>REP (Reply to):</dt><dd>Optional; Variable length; Repeatable.  This field
contains an address given as a contact for problems/questions in transmission. 
It may include an Internet or postal address.</dd>

<dt>NOT (Note):</dt><dd>Optional; Variable length; Repeatable.  This field
contains textual information or messages about the file.</dd>

<h4><a name="recfile">ELECTRONIC TRANSFER OF LABEL AND RECORD
FILES</a></h4>
<p>Each file is transferred electronically as a separate operation.  If no
compression is involved, a label file should be transferred preceding the MARC 21
record file to which it relates.  If label and record files have been compressed,
the transfer of all data can occur as a single operation to the receiving system. 
In this case, the receiving system must process the compressed file to restore
the label and record file(s) as separate files.</p>
