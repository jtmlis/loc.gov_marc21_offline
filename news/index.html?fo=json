It is also the first time that the volumes have been assembled in one place in the original order that Jefferson himself devised since the collection came to Washington in 1815.

Hours for the exhibition are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday- Saturday.</p><p>Items from the exhibition are available on the <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov\" target=\"_blank\">Library's Web site</a>, and by April 24 the Library's entire collection of Jefferson Papers (more than 25,000 items) will be accessible on-line.</p><p>Thomas Jefferson -- founding father, farmer, architect, inventor, slaveholder, book collector, scholar, diplomat and third president of the United States -- was a complex figure who contributed immeasurably to the creation of the new republicanism in America. Wherever Anglo- American culture has shaped political and intellectual developments, Jefferson is almost inevitably part of the mix. Drawing on the extraordinary written legacy of Thomas Jefferson that is held in the Library's collections, the exhibition traces Jefferson's development from his earliest days in Virginia to an ever- expanding realm of influence in republican Virginia, the American Revolutionary government, the creation of the American nation, the revolution in individual rights in America and the world, the revolution in France, and the burgeoning republican revolutionary movement throughout the world. Items borrowed from other institutions contribute to the exhibition's attempt to offer viewers a fully rounded portrait of the nation's third president.</p><p>The exhibition focuses on the complexities and contradictions of Thomas Jefferson, the man, the myth, the model. He was simultaneously an unquenchable idealist and a hard-headed realist. He deplored inequality among men, but owned slaves, supported servitude, and relegated women to a secondary role. He supported freedom of the press until his own foibles and politics became the focus. He was a firm believer in the separation of church and state, but he was often accused of being anti-Christian. He expounded the virtues of public education, ensured that his own daughters were well educated, and founded a public university at Charlottesville, but he assumed that access to higher education would be strictly limited. His life embodies the public and private struggles of life in a democratic republic.</p><p>Some 150 items in the eight sections will illustrate and provide a context for the life and character of Thomas Jefferson. The final and ninth section will be the reassembled \"Jefferson Library.\" Visitors to the exhibition will see such items as the only surviving fragment of the earliest known draft of the Declaration of Independence as well as the desk on which he composed the Declaration; Martha Jefferson's thread case; Jefferson's instructions to Lewis and Clark; political cartoons of the day lampooning Jefferson; and the last letter that Thomas Jefferson wrote to the mayor of the city of Washington just 10 days before he died, espousing his vision of the Declaration of Independence and the American nation as signals of the blessings of self-government to an ever- evolving world.</p><p>\"Life and Labor at Monticello\" examines how Jefferson's family, his era, education, role as plantation master and slaveholder, and his love and use of books influenced his character and the formation of his ideas on individual and institutional rights and limits. Items include:</p><ul><li>Thomas Jefferson's Memorandum Book, 1773, where he kept detailed records on his expenditures including the purchase of slaves</li><li>Plantation account books kept by Jefferson's wife and then his granddaughter, recording purchases made from Monticello slaves, especially the Hemings family, for vegetables and fowl from the slave families' own flocks and gardens</li><li>The 1873 memoir by Madison Hemings published in the <em>Pike County</em> (Ohio) <em>Republican,</em> who testified that his mother, Sally Hemings, gave birth to five children \"and Jefferson was the father of them all.\"</li><li>Letters Jefferson exchanged in 1791 with Benjamin Banneker, a free black living in Maryland, in which Jefferson praised Banneker's mathematical accomplishment (\"no body wishes more than I do to see such proofs as you exhibit, that nature has given to our black brethren, talents equal to those of the other colors of men...\") as well as with Abb\u00e9 Henri Gregoire in 1809 trying to explain why he asserted the inferiority of African Americans in his <em>Notes on the State of Virginia</em> published in 1785</li><li>Letter written by Thomas Jefferson to John Adams in 1815 in which he says, \"I cannot live without books, but fewer will suffice where amusement, and not use, is the only future object.\"</li></ul><p>The exhibition continues by demonstrating the expanding influence of Jefferson on American life and his interest in creating a culture based on republican principles -- first in his own state of Virginia, then on the federal scene with his drafting of the Declaration of Independence and his election to the presidency in 1800. On view are:</p><ul><li>One of the nation's greatest treasures -- Jefferson's \"original Rough draught\" of the Declaration of Independence. The \"Rough draught\" is the final draft presented by Jefferson to his fellow committee members and indicates changes made by John Adams and Benjamin Franklin.</li><li>Fragment of the earliest known draft of the Declaration of Independence in Jefferson's hand</li><li>An 1806 document in President Jefferson's hand calling upon Congress to end the practice of importing slaves as soon as permitted by the U.S. Constitution in 1808</li><li><em>Notes on the State of Virginia,</em> 1785, the only book ever published by Thomas Jefferson</li></ul><p>\"The West\" explores Thomas Jefferson's persistent fascination with the vast part of the continent that lay beyond Virginia -- an area he never saw -- and his conviction that the new nation had to expand westward in order to survive. A highlight is Jefferson's instructions to the explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark before they set out to map and explore the Western territories with their Corps of Discovery in 1803. Visitors can also see a Nicholas King manuscript map documenting the Lewis and Clark expedition that is annotated by Lewis with information from fur traders and Native Americans.</p><p>The influence of Jefferson's republican ideas were felt far beyond America, especially in France, his first experience on the world stage beyond America. He became an ardent supporter of the French revolution and often consulted with Lafayette during the drafting of the French Declaration of the Rights of Man. In a July 9, 1789, letter to Jefferson, Lafayette asked him for his \"observations\" on \"my bill of rights\" before presenting it to the National Assembly. On view in the exhibition is a manuscript copy of the French Declaration written in a clerical hand, with emendations in the hand of Thomas Jefferson. Also in the exhibition is the 1789 passport that Thomas Jefferson used upon his return from France, signed by King Louis XVI.</p><p>The exhibition concludes with \"Epitaph: Take Care of Me,\" which reviews Jefferson's own evaluation of the meaning of his life and his thoughts about how he would be viewed by history. Key items here are:</p><ul><li>A sketch and wording for Jefferson's tombstone, in his own hand</li><li>A letter explaining his position on slavery, written just six weeks before his death</li><li>A letter to Jefferson from his granddaughter, Ellen Randolph Coolidge, despairing of the \"canker of slavery\" that oppresses the Southern states</li><li>A newspaper account of the sale of Jefferson's slaves by his heirs in order to pay off estate debts</li></ul><p>A volume accompanying the exhibition, <em>Thomas Jefferson: Genius of Liberty,</em> includes an introduction by Garry Wills and essays by Jefferson scholars Pauline Maier, Charles A. Miller, Annette Gordon-Reed, Peter S. Onuf and Joseph J. Ellis. Published by Viking Studio, the hardcover volume is highly illustrated with mostly color images and sells for $35.

These materials comprise a bibliographical mix of known types or genres (serials and other text-based items) and newer forms such as multimedia, Web sites, databases, discussion forums, and on-line services. These resources have presented a number of cataloging problems related to their bibliographic control, raising questions about the overall applicability of established cataloging practices to these resources. As a consequence, various groups have undertaken separate and, in some cases, overlapping initiatives to address these problems. These divergent and diverse initiatives underscore the need to bring together leaders in the library and other metadata communities to discuss their work. This special conference will provide that opportunity with a program dedicated to the theme of promoting the effective organization of networked resources.</p><p>Topics will be presented in six main sessions: examining the library catalog and its challenges as a portal to the Web; assessing current library and metadata standards for bibliographic control and Web access; addressing actions and plans for the future direction of these standards and of other mechanisms designed to advance description and access to networked resources; examining the results of particular metadata experiments and initiatives, including the descriptive resource needs of reference providers; exploring potential partnerships among the library, metadata, and vendor communities that will foster the development of new or expanded Web-based projects; and identifying outcomes with the completion of action plans and an overall strategy to meet conference goals.</p><p>The two-and-one-half-day event will include presentations, panel discussions, breakout sessions, and technology demonstrations by vendors and project managers. Participation is by invitation only. However, because attendance is limited, the presenters will be asked to submit their papers well in advance of the meeting dates; these will be posted to the conference home page to be developed and made available for comment on an electronic discussion list to be established by the Library of Congress. Following the conference, all papers will be compiled for publication. In addition, the Cataloging Directorate is considering cybercasting the conference.

Friends, family members, colleagues, and admirers will recall the composer's life and career, focusing in particular on her vocal and choral music and the cultural milieus in which she worked. Speakers will include Virginia Bortin, a close friend and biographer of the composer, noted soprano Rose Bampton and baritone Thomas Hampson.</p><p>Later that evening, at 8 p.m. in the Coolidge Auditorium, the Library and the Warren Society will co-sponsor a recital of Warren's art songs and solo piano works, featuring Thomas Hampson, tenor Stanford Olsen, soprano Christine Goerke, mezzo-soprano Margaret Lattimore, and pianist Craig Rutenberg.</p><p>The weekend-long centenary celebration is long-overdue recognition for Warren, who, as recently as the 1970s, was one of America's five most performed women composers. Born and raised in Los Angeles, she trained as a pianist and became a highly coveted recital partner but saw herself first and foremost as a composer. She created musical settings for texts by Carl Sandburg and Edna St. Vincent Millay, and her art songs were regularly performed by such artists as Kirsten Flagstad and Bidu Sayao.</p><p>During the 1930s, she expanded her range into larger choral and orchestral works. Her first international success came in 1940, when the Los Angeles Philharmonic premiered <em>The Legend of King Arthur,</em> a choral symphony based on Alfred Lord Tennyson's <em>Idylls of the King.</em></p><p>Over the course of her career, Warren published some 200 art songs, orchestral and chamber works, and compositions for chorus and orchestra. Her music attracted such conductors as Pierre Monteux, John Barbirolli, Andre Kostelanetz, Wilfrid Pelletier, and Alfred Wallenstein. During the last two decades, however, her work has slipped out of the repertory, and it is only in recent years that her distinctive neo-Romantic harmonies have begun to find new audiences.</p><p>\"Her texts are so well set that you can really communicate with them,\" mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne has said. \"It's time she was given a place in the international musical scene.\"</p><p>Mr. Hampson has called Warren's work \"one of the highly pleasurable discoveries of my American musical journey.\" Mr. Hampson will headline a special performance of The Legend of King Arthur on Sunday, March 19, at 4 p.m. at the Washington National Cathedral. He will be joined by the Cathedral Choral Society and full orchestra, conducted by music director J. Reilly Lewis.</p><p>In honor of Elinor Remick Warren, the Library of Congress and the Elinor Remick Warren Society are also co-sponsoring a master class on the art of accompanying with Craig Rutenberg. Recognized as one of today's most distinguished accompanists, Rutenberg has appeared in recital with Denyce Graves, Susanne Mentzer, Frederica von Stade, and Dawn Upshaw. The class will take place Friday, March 17, at the School of Music, University of Maryland, College Park. Interested persons should call Rita Sloan, at (301) 405-5527, for details.</p><p>Free tickets for the March 18 recital are being distributed by TicketMaster at (301) 808-6900 or (410) 752-1200, for a nominal service charge of $2 per ticket, with additional charges for phone orders and handling. Tickets are also available at TicketMaster outlets. Although the supply of tickets may be exhausted, there are often empty seats at concert time.

The Library of Congress plans to exhibit the books as part of a major exhibition on Thomas Jefferson that opens April 24, the Library's 200th birthday.</p><p>At the suggestion of Albert H. Small, a member of both the University of Virginia's Board of Visitors and the Library of Congress's Madison Council, as well as a participant in the Monticello Cabinet, University librarians reviewed the list of missing volumes and found that the university held two copies of Constantin-Francois Volney's <em>The Ruins: Or a Survey of the Revolutions of Empires,</em> a translation from the French <em>Les Ruines ou Meditations sur les Revolutions des Empires,</em> published in 1796 by William A. Davis in New York. This translation of Volney's work is the same edition as the one Jefferson sold to Congress.</p><p>In accepting the volume, Librarian of Congress James H. Billington said, \"We are grateful to the University of Virginia for generously offering one of their own books to help us reconstitute Jefferson's library. We encourage other libraries to become inspired by the example of the University of Virginia and search their collections for Jefferson titles. We hope this grand project will revitalize public interest in the principle on which the Library of Congress has been built -- that free access to knowledge, by both the governing and the governed, is essential to democracy.\"</p><p>Karin Wittenborg, university librarian at the University of Virginia, said, \"We feel a special affinity for the Library of Congress, beyond the simple fact that we are two research libraries with important collections relating to Jefferson and American history and literature. Both of our founding collections were personally selected by Thomas Jefferson.\"</p><p>Mark Dimunation, chief of the Rare Book and Special Collections division at the Library of Congress, said that because of Jefferson's importance as the author of the Declaration of Independence and as the country's third president, it is important to know the sources that influenced Jefferson's thinking. Books were \"his laboratory,\" Mr. Dimunation said.</p><p>In the case of Volney, a philosopher who taught at the Ecole Normal Superieure in Paris, he was an author well-known to Jefferson. During Jefferson's years in France, they likely met at the salon of Madame Helevetius, and Volney also visited Jefferson at Monticello the same year the English translation of <em>Les Ruines</em> appeared. That they shared many of the same views can be certain. In his work, Volney combines picturesque description with philosophical discussion, suggested by the ruins of the past, on the origin and growth of social, political, and religious institutions. Volney concludes his discussion in favor of the equality of all men before the law and the overthrow of tyranny, and from his comparison of religions, he infers the necessity of toleration and agnosticism in religious matters, where truth is not verifiable. These ideas are similar to those represented in Jefferson's writing of the Declaration of Independence and the statute of Virginia for religious freedom.</p><p>The rebuilding of Jefferson's library is one of many projects initiated by the Library of Congress to celebrate its 200th anniversary on April 24, 2000. Other projects include documenting local heritage in every state, symposia, exhibitions, special acquisitions, poetry readings, and the issuance of a commemorative stamp and coin during a National Birthday Party at the Library on April 24.</p>", "contact_press": "Library of Congress: Craig D'Ooge (202) 707-9189\nUniversity of Virginia: Carol Wood (804) 924-6189", "division": ["rarebook"], "media_advisory": "0", "press_release_number": "00-017", "profile": "news", "short_title": "University of Virginia Donates Jefferson Book to LC", "topic": ["american_history"]}, "language": ["english"], "location": ["united states", "washington d.c."], "mime_type": ["text/html"], "online_format": ["web page"], "original_format": ["web page"], "other_title": [], "partof": ["news from the library of congress", "rare book & special collections division"], "shelf_id": "00-017", "subject": ["announcements", "american_history"], "timestamp": "2020-12-12T16:21:48.092Z", "title": "University of Virginia Donates Book to Library of Congress to Help Reconstitute Thomas Jefferson's Library", "url": "https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-00-017/university-of-virginia-donates-book-to-library-of-congress-to-help-reconstitute-thomas-jeffersons-library/2000-02-24/"}, {"access_restricted": false, "aka": ["wordpress:/news/?p=35934", "http://www.loc.gov/item/prn-00-018/william-jay-smith-to-read-his-poems-at-the-library-of-congress-march-16/", "http://www.loc.gov/item/prn-00-018/", "http://www.loc.gov/item/prn-00-018/william-jay-smith-to-read-his-poems-at-the-library-of-congress-march-16/2000-02-24/"], "campaigns": [], "date": "2000-02-24", "dates": ["2000-02-24T00:00:00Z"], "description": ["<p>On Thursday evening, March 16, poet William Jay Smith will give a reading at the Library of Congress.

The reconstituted Jefferson's library should be more than 90 percent complete by April 24.</p><p>The display of Jefferson's library as part of this exhibition will be the first time ever that the public will be able to view Jefferson's library. It is also the first time that the volumes have been assembled in one place in the original order that Jefferson himself devised since the collection came to Washington in 1815. Visitors to the exhibition will be able to tell which volumes were owned by Jefferson and sold to Congress in 1815, which were recently identified and pulled from the Library's general collections, which have been recently purchased, and which are still missing.</p><p>\"Thomas Jefferson\" will be on view in the Northwest Gallery and Pavilion of the Thomas Jefferson Building, 10 First Street S.E., from April 24 through October 31. Hours for the exhibition are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday- Saturday.</p><p>Items from the exhibition are available on the <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov\" target=\"_blank\">Library's Web site</a>, and by April 24 the Library's entire collection of Jefferson Papers (more than 25,000 items) will be accessible on-line.</p><p>Thomas Jefferson -- founding father, farmer, architect, inventor, slaveholder, book collector, scholar, diplomat and third president of the United States -- was a complex figure who contributed immeasurably to the creation of the new republicanism in America. Wherever Anglo- American culture has shaped political and intellectual developments, Jefferson is almost inevitably part of the mix. Drawing on the extraordinary written legacy of Thomas Jefferson that is held in the Library's collections, the exhibition traces Jefferson's development from his earliest days in Virginia to an ever- expanding realm of influence in republican Virginia, the American Revolutionary government, the creation of the American nation, the revolution in individual rights in America and the world, the revolution in France, and the burgeoning republican revolutionary movement throughout the world. Items borrowed from other institutions contribute to the exhibition's attempt to offer viewers a fully rounded portrait of the nation's third president.</p><p>The exhibition focuses on the complexities and contradictions of Thomas Jefferson, the man, the myth, the model. He was simultaneously an unquenchable idealist and a hard-headed realist. He deplored inequality among men, but owned slaves, supported servitude, and relegated women to a secondary role. He supported freedom of the press until his own foibles and politics became the focus. He was a firm believer in the separation of church and state, but he was often accused of being anti-Christian. He expounded the virtues of public education, ensured that his own daughters were well educated, and founded a public university at Charlottesville, but he assumed that access to higher education would be strictly limited. His life embodies the public and private struggles of life in a democratic republic.</p><p>Some 150 items in the eight sections will illustrate and provide a context for the life and character of Thomas Jefferson. The final and ninth section will be the reassembled \"Jefferson Library.\" Visitors to the exhibition will see such items as the only surviving fragment of the earliest known draft of the Declaration of Independence as well as the desk on which he composed the Declaration; Martha Jefferson's thread case; Jefferson's instructions to Lewis and Clark; political cartoons of the day lampooning Jefferson; and the last letter that Thomas Jefferson wrote to the mayor of the city of Washington just 10 days before he died, espousing his vision of the Declaration of Independence and the American nation as signals of the blessings of self-government to an ever- evolving world.</p><p>\"Life and Labor at Monticello\" examines how Jefferson's family, his era, education, role as plantation master and slaveholder, and his love and use of books influenced his character and the formation of his ideas on individual and institutional rights and limits. Items include:</p><ul><li>Thomas Jefferson's Memorandum Book, 1773, where he kept detailed records on his expenditures including the purchase of slaves</li><li>Plantation account books kept by Jefferson's wife and then his granddaughter, recording purchases made from Monticello slaves, especially the Hemings family, for vegetables and fowl from the slave families' own flocks and gardens</li><li>The 1873 memoir by Madison Hemings published in the <em>Pike County</em> (Ohio) <em>Republican,</em> who testified that his mother, Sally Hemings, gave birth to five children \"and Jefferson was the father of them all.\"</li><li>Letters Jefferson exchanged in 1791 with Benjamin Banneker, a free black living in Maryland, in which Jefferson praised Banneker's mathematical accomplishment (\"no body wishes more than I do to see such proofs as you exhibit, that nature has given to our black brethren, talents equal to those of the other colors of men...\") as well as with Abb\u00e9 Henri Gregoire in 1809 trying to explain why he asserted the inferiority of African Americans in his <em>Notes on the State of Virginia</em> published in 1785</li><li>Letter written by Thomas Jefferson to John Adams in 1815 in which he says, \"I cannot live without books, but fewer will suffice where amusement, and not use, is the only future object.\"</li></ul><p>The exhibition continues by demonstrating the expanding influence of Jefferson on American life and his interest in creating a culture based on republican principles -- first in his own state of Virginia, then on the federal scene with his drafting of the Declaration of Independence and his election to the presidency in 1800. On view are:</p><ul><li>One of the nation's greatest treasures -- Jefferson's \"original Rough draught\" of the Declaration of Independence. The \"Rough draught\" is the final draft presented by Jefferson to his fellow committee members and indicates changes made by John Adams and Benjamin Franklin.</li><li>Fragment of the earliest known draft of the Declaration of Independence in Jefferson's hand</li><li>An 1806 document in President Jefferson's hand calling upon Congress to end the practice of importing slaves as soon as permitted by the U.S. Constitution in 1808</li><li><em>Notes on the State of Virginia,</em> 1785, the only book ever published by Thomas Jefferson</li></ul><p>\"The West\" explores Thomas Jefferson's persistent fascination with the vast part of the continent that lay beyond Virginia -- an area he never saw -- and his conviction that the new nation had to expand westward in order to survive. A highlight is Jefferson's instructions to the explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark before they set out to map and explore the Western territories with their Corps of Discovery in 1803. Visitors can also see a Nicholas King manuscript map documenting the Lewis and Clark expedition that is annotated by Lewis with information from fur traders and Native Americans.</p><p>The influence of Jefferson's republican ideas were felt far beyond America, especially in France, his first experience on the world stage beyond America. He became an ardent supporter of the French revolution and often consulted with Lafayette during the drafting of the French Declaration of the Rights of Man. In a July 9, 1789, letter to Jefferson, Lafayette asked him for his \"observations\" on \"my bill of rights\" before presenting it to the National Assembly. On view in the exhibition is a manuscript copy of the French Declaration written in a clerical hand, with emendations in the hand of Thomas Jefferson. Also in the exhibition is the 1789 passport that Thomas Jefferson used upon his return from France, signed by King Louis XVI.</p><p>The exhibition concludes with \"Epitaph: Take Care of Me,\" which reviews Jefferson's own evaluation of the meaning of his life and his thoughts about how he would be viewed by history. Key items here are:</p><ul><li>A sketch and wording for Jefferson's tombstone, in his own hand</li><li>A letter explaining his position on slavery, written just six weeks before his death</li><li>A letter to Jefferson from his granddaughter, Ellen Randolph Coolidge, despairing of the \"canker of slavery\" that oppresses the Southern states</li><li>A newspaper account of the sale of Jefferson's slaves by his heirs in order to pay off estate debts</li></ul><p>A volume accompanying the exhibition, <em>Thomas Jefferson: Genius of Liberty,</em> includes an introduction by Garry Wills and essays by Jefferson scholars Pauline Maier, Charles A. Miller, Annette Gordon-Reed, Peter S. Onuf and Joseph J. Ellis. Published by Viking Studio, the hardcover volume is highly illustrated with mostly color images and sells for $35. It is available in major bookstores and from the Library's Sales Shops; order with major credit card by calling (202) 707-0204.</p>", "contact": "Helen Dalrymple (202) 707-1940", "contact_plain": "<a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/jefferson\">View the exhibition online</a>.", "division": ["manuscript", "rarebook"], "media_advisory": "0", "press_release_number": "00-009", "profile": "news", "short_title": "Thomas Jefferson Exhibition", "sub_headline": "Jefferson's Library Reassembled for First Time Since 1815", "topic": ["american_history"]}, "language": ["english"], "location": ["united states", "washington d.c."], "mime_type": ["text/html"], "online_format": ["web page"], "original_format": ["web page"], "other_title": [], "partof": ["news from the library of congress", "rare book & special collections division", "manuscript division"], "shelf_id": "00-009", "subject": ["announcements", "the library in the news", "american_history"], "timestamp": "2020-12-12T16:21:48.092Z", "title": "Library of Congress Celebrates Bicentennial with Major Exhibition on Thomas Jefferson", "url": "https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-00-009/library-of-congress-celebrates-bicentennial-with-major-exhibition-on-thomas-jefferson/2000-03-13/"}, {"access_restricted": false, "aka": ["wordpress:/news/?p=35916", "http://www.loc.gov/item/prn-00-010/the-wizard-of-oz-is-saluted-in-library-of-congress-bicentennial-exhibition/", "http://www.loc.gov/item/prn-00-010/", "http://www.loc.gov/item/prn-00-010/the-wizard-of-oz-is-saluted-in-library-of-congress-bicentennial-exhibition/2000-03-07/"], "campaigns": [], "date": "2000-03-07", "dates": ["2000-03-07T00:00:00Z"], "description": ["The \"yellow brick road\" leads to the Library of Congress on April 21 with the opening of an exhibition marking the 100th anniversary of one of America's most beloved stories, \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.\" The Library's Copyright Office registered this work by L.

These materials comprise a bibliographical mix of known types or genres (serials and other text-based items) and newer forms such as multimedia, Web sites, databases, discussion forums, and on-line services. These resources have presented a number of cataloging problems related to their bibliographic control, raising questions about the overall applicability of established cataloging practices to these resources. As a consequence, various groups have undertaken separate and, in some cases, overlapping initiatives to address these problems. These divergent and diverse initiatives underscore the need to bring together leaders in the library and other metadata communities to discuss their work. This special conference will provide that opportunity with a program dedicated to the theme of promoting the effective organization of networked resources.</p><p>Topics will be presented in six main sessions: examining the library catalog and its challenges as a portal to the Web; assessing current library and metadata standards for bibliographic control and Web access; addressing actions and plans for the future direction of these standards and of other mechanisms designed to advance description and access to networked resources; examining the results of particular metadata experiments and initiatives, including the descriptive resource needs of reference providers; exploring potential partnerships among the library, metadata, and vendor communities that will foster the development of new or expanded Web-based projects; and identifying outcomes with the completion of action plans and an overall strategy to meet conference goals.</p><p>The two-and-one-half-day event will include presentations, panel discussions, breakout sessions, and technology demonstrations by vendors and project managers. Participation is by invitation only. However, because attendance is limited, the presenters will be asked to submit their papers well in advance of the meeting dates; these will be posted to the conference home page to be developed and made available for comment on an electronic discussion list to be established by the Library of Congress.

In this story, Motown Records had a distinct role to play in the city's black community as it promoted its social, cultural, and political agendas.

Friends, family members, colleagues, and admirers will recall the composer's life and career, focusing in particular on her vocal and choral music and the cultural milieus in which she worked. Speakers will include Virginia Bortin, a close friend and biographer of the composer, noted soprano Rose Bampton and baritone Thomas Hampson.</p><p>Later that evening, at 8 p.m. in the Coolidge Auditorium, the Library and the Warren Society will co-sponsor a recital of Warren's art songs and solo piano works, featuring Thomas Hampson, tenor Stanford Olsen, soprano Christine Goerke, mezzo-soprano Margaret Lattimore, and pianist Craig Rutenberg.</p><p>The weekend-long centenary celebration is long-overdue recognition for Warren, who, as recently as the 1970s, was one of America's five most performed women composers. Born and raised in Los Angeles, she trained as a pianist and became a highly coveted recital partner but saw herself first and foremost as a composer. She created musical settings for texts by Carl Sandburg and Edna St. Vincent Millay, and her art songs were regularly performed by such artists as Kirsten Flagstad and Bidu Sayao.</p><p>During the 1930s, she expanded her range into larger choral and orchestral works. Her first international success came in 1940, when the Los Angeles Philharmonic premiered <em>The Legend of King Arthur,</em> a choral symphony based on Alfred Lord Tennyson's <em>Idylls of the King.</em></p><p>Over the course of her career, Warren published some 200 art songs, orchestral and chamber works, and compositions for chorus and orchestra. Her music attracted such conductors as Pierre Monteux, John Barbirolli, Andre Kostelanetz, Wilfrid Pelletier, and Alfred Wallenstein. During the last two decades, however, her work has slipped out of the repertory, and it is only in recent years that her distinctive neo-Romantic harmonies have begun to find new audiences.</p><p>\"Her texts are so well set that you can really communicate with them,\" mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne has said. \"It's time she was given a place in the international musical scene.\"</p><p>Mr. Hampson has called Warren's work \"one of the highly pleasurable discoveries of my American musical journey.\" Mr. Hampson will headline a special performance of The Legend of King Arthur on Sunday, March 19, at 4 p.m. at the Washington National Cathedral. He will be joined by the Cathedral Choral Society and full orchestra, conducted by music director J. Reilly Lewis.</p><p>In honor of Elinor Remick Warren, the Library of Congress and the Elinor Remick Warren Society are also co-sponsoring a master class on the art of accompanying with Craig Rutenberg. Recognized as one of today's most distinguished accompanists, Rutenberg has appeared in recital with Denyce Graves, Susanne Mentzer, Frederica von Stade, and Dawn Upshaw. The class will take place Friday, March 17, at the School of Music, University of Maryland, College Park. Interested persons should call Rita Sloan, at (301) 405-5527, for details.</p><p>Free tickets for the March 18 recital are being distributed by TicketMaster at (301) 808-6900 or (410) 752-1200, for a nominal service charge of $2 per ticket, with additional charges for phone orders and handling.

The Library of Congress plans to exhibit the books as part of a major exhibition on Thomas Jefferson that opens April 24, the Library's 200th birthday.</p><p>At the suggestion of Albert H. Small, a member of both the University of Virginia's Board of Visitors and the Library of Congress's Madison Council, as well as a participant in the Monticello Cabinet, University librarians reviewed the list of missing volumes and found that the university held two copies of Constantin-Francois Volney's <em>The Ruins: Or a Survey of the Revolutions of Empires,</em> a translation from the French <em>Les Ruines ou Meditations sur les Revolutions des Empires,</em> published in 1796 by William A. Davis in New York. This translation of Volney's work is the same edition as the one Jefferson sold to Congress.</p><p>In accepting the volume, Librarian of Congress James H. Billington said, \"We are grateful to the University of Virginia for generously offering one of their own books to help us reconstitute Jefferson's library. We encourage other libraries to become inspired by the example of the University of Virginia and search their collections for Jefferson titles. We hope this grand project will revitalize public interest in the principle on which the Library of Congress has been built -- that free access to knowledge, by both the governing and the governed, is essential to democracy.\"</p><p>Karin Wittenborg, university librarian at the University of Virginia, said, \"We feel a special affinity for the Library of Congress, beyond the simple fact that we are two research libraries with important collections relating to Jefferson and American history and literature. Both of our founding collections were personally selected by Thomas Jefferson.\"</p><p>Mark Dimunation, chief of the Rare Book and Special Collections division at the Library of Congress, said that because of Jefferson's importance as the author of the Declaration of Independence and as the country's third president, it is important to know the sources that influenced Jefferson's thinking. Books were \"his laboratory,\" Mr. Dimunation said.</p><p>In the case of Volney, a philosopher who taught at the Ecole Normal Superieure in Paris, he was an author well-known to Jefferson. During Jefferson's years in France, they likely met at the salon of Madame Helevetius, and Volney also visited Jefferson at Monticello the same year the English translation of <em>Les Ruines</em> appeared. That they shared many of the same views can be certain. In his work, Volney combines picturesque description with philosophical discussion, suggested by the ruins of the past, on the origin and growth of social, political, and religious institutions. Volney concludes his discussion in favor of the equality of all men before the law and the overthrow of tyranny, and from his comparison of religions, he infers the necessity of toleration and agnosticism in religious matters, where truth is not verifiable. These ideas are similar to those represented in Jefferson's writing of the Declaration of Independence and the statute of Virginia for religious freedom.</p><p>The rebuilding of Jefferson's library is one of many projects initiated by the Library of Congress to celebrate its 200th anniversary on April 24, 2000. Other projects include documenting local heritage in every state, symposia, exhibitions, special acquisitions, poetry readings, and the issuance of a commemorative stamp and coin during a National Birthday Party at the Library on April 24.</p>", "contact_press": "Library of Congress: Craig D'Ooge (202) 707-9189\nUniversity of Virginia: Carol Wood (804) 924-6189", "division": ["rarebook"], "media_advisory": "0", "press_release_number": "00-017", "profile": "news", "short_title": "University of Virginia Donates Jefferson Book to LC", "topic": ["american_history"]}, "language": ["english"], "location": ["united states", "washington d.c."], "mime_type": ["text/html"], "online_format": ["web page"], "original_format": ["web page"], "other_title": [], "partof": ["news from the library of congress", "rare book & special collections division"], "shelf_id": "00-017", "subject": ["announcements", "american_history"], "timestamp": "2020-12-12T16:21:48.092Z", "title": "University of Virginia Donates Book to Library of Congress to Help Reconstitute Thomas Jefferson's Library", "url": "https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-00-017/university-of-virginia-donates-book-to-library-of-congress-to-help-reconstitute-thomas-jeffersons-library/2000-02-24/"}, {"access_restricted": false, "aka": ["wordpress:/news/?p=35934", "http://www.loc.gov/item/prn-00-018/william-jay-smith-to-read-his-poems-at-the-library-of-congress-march-16/", "http://www.loc.gov/item/prn-00-018/", "http://www.loc.gov/item/prn-00-018/william-jay-smith-to-read-his-poems-at-the-library-of-congress-march-16/2000-02-24/"], "campaigns": [], "date": "2000-02-24", "dates": ["2000-02-24T00:00:00Z"], "description": ["<p>On Thursday evening, March 16, poet William Jay Smith will give a reading at the Library of Congress.

The comic bits include a renowned pie-fighting sequence where the principle of \u201creciprocal destruction\u201d escalates to epic proportions. \u201cBattle\u201d offers a stark illustration of the detective work (and luck) required to locate and preserve films from the silent era. Only excerpts from reel two of the film had survived for many years. Critic Leonard Maltin discovered a mostly complete nitrate copy of reel one at the Museum of Modern Art in the 1970s. Then in 2015, film collector and silent film accompanist Jon Mirsalis located a complete version of reel two as part of a film collection he purchased from the Estate of Gordon Berkow. The film still lacks brief scenes from reel one, but the film is now almost complete, comprising elements from MoMA, the Library of Congress, UCLA and other sources.

An homage of sorts to various classic movie genres \u2014 from screwball comedy to road movie \u2014 \u201cThe Blues Brothers\u201d serves as a tribute to the lead duo\u2019s favorite city (Chicago) as well as a lovely paean to great soul and R&amp;B music.\u00a0 In musical cameos, such legends as Cab Calloway, Ray Charles, James Brown, Aretha Franklin and John Lee Hooker all ignite the screen.\u00a0</p><p><strong>Bread (1918)<br /></strong>Billed as a \u201csociological photodrama, \u201cBread\u201d tells the story of a na\u00efve young woman in a narrow-minded town who journeys to New York to become a star but faces disillusionment when she learns that sex is demanded as the price for fame. Ida May Park, director and scenarist of \u201cBread,\u201d was among more than a half-dozen prolific women directors working at the Universal Film Manufacturing Company during the period in which Los Angeles became the home of America\u2019s movie industry. Park directed 14 feature-length films between 1917 and 1920, and her career as a scenarist lasted until 1931. She reasoned that because the majority of movie fans were women, \u201cit follows that a member of the sex is best able to gauge their wants in the form of stories and plays.\u201d In an essay Park contributed to the book \u201cCareers for Women,\u201d she stated that women were advantaged as motion picture directors because of \u201cthe superiority of their emotional and imaginative faculties.\u201d In the two surviving reels of \u201cBread,\u201d one of only three films Park directed that are currently known to exist, she displays an accomplished ability to knowingly vivify her protagonist\u2019s plight as she fends off an attacker and places her frail hopes in a misshapen loaf of bread that has come to symbolize for her the good things in life.</p><p><strong>Buena Vista Social Club (1999)<br /></strong>\u201cThe best Wim Wenders documentary to date and an uncommonly self-effacing one, this 1999 concert movie about performance and lifestyle is comparable in some ways to \u2018Latcho Drom,\u2019 the great Gypsy documentary/musical. In 1996, musician Ry Cooder traveled to Havana to reunite some of the greatest stars of Cuban pop music from the Batista era (who were virtually forgotten after Castro came to power) with the aim of making a record, a highly successful venture that led to concerts in Amsterdam and New York. The players and their stories are as wonderful as the music, and the filmmaking is uncommonly sensitive and alert,\u201d wrote film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum.</p><p><strong>Cabin in the Sky (1943)<br /></strong>\u201cCabin\u201d tells the story of a man (Eddie \u201cRochester\u201d Anderson) trying to make it into heaven and who is sent back to earth for one last shot at redemption. Released the same year as Fox\u2019s \u201cStormy Weather,\u201d this film adaptation of the 1940 Broadway musical marked the directing debut of renowned director Vincente Minnelli (\u201cMeet Me in St. Louis,\u201d \u201cAn American in Paris,\u201d \u201cBad and the Beautiful,\u201d \u201cThe Band Wagon,\u201d and \u201cGigi\u201d). Minnelli\u2019s gift for ingeniously blending in dazzling musical numbers is on full display throughout. Lauded at the time for showcasing an all-Black cast in a major Hollywood film when many theaters in the U.S. were still segregated, the film also sadly demonstrates the limited film opportunities and acting compromises African Americans had to make during the Hollywood classic era. These notable concerns aside, \u201cCabin\u201d remains a glittering cultural record of outstanding African American artistic talent of the era (Ethel Waters, Lena Horne, Louis Armstrong, Rex Ingram, and Eddie \u201cRochester\u201d Anderson.)\u00a0</p><p><strong>A Clockwork Orange (1971)<br /></strong>Though based on the book by Anthony Burgess, it certainly took an eye and a mind like director Stanley Kubrick\u2019s to bring this film to life. Set in a not-so-distant future, that is equal parts dystopian and cartoonish, \u201cClockwork,\u201d now almost 50 years after its creation, remains as it always was: disturbing, controversial and startlingly unsettling. Malcolm MacDowell (in his most legendary role) stars as Alex DeLarge, the demented, de facto leader of a gang of boys-- sporting bowler hats, canes and codpieces--who wreak havoc all over what used to be England.\u00a0 But as evil as Alex is, when he\u2019s caught and subjected to a type of state-sanctioned crime aversion therapy, his \u201ctreatment\u201d turns out to be far more brutal than any of the crimes he\u2019s ever committed.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><strong>The Dark Knight (2008)<br /></strong>Bob Kane and Bill Finger\u2019s dark, enduring creation first flew onto the screen in a 1943 B-movie serial and would return to theaters several times in treatments both camp and action-oriented. But Christopher Nolan\u2019s evocative 2008 work reinvented the already vast Batman mythos thanks in no small part to its two intense, now legendary, lead performances:\u00a0 Christian Bale as the titular character and Heath Ledger, in a remarkable, Oscar-winning take on Bat super-villain \u201cThe Joker.\u201d\u00a0 Set in a dark, modern-day Gotham City, \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d is a visual feast of memorable set pieces, screenwriting flair, and characters and situations imbued with a soul and a conscience. \u201cPitched at the divide between art and industry, poetry and entertainment, \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d goes darker and deeper than any Hollywood movie of its comic-book kind,\u201d wrote Manohla Dargis of The New York Times. The theme of a world turned upside down by fear and dystopian chaos resonates eerily well in the pandemic havoc of 2020.</p><p><strong>The Devil Never Sleeps (1994)</strong><br />Early one Sunday morning in July, the filmmaker receives a phone call informing her that her beloved tio (uncle) Oscar Ruiz Almeida has been found dead of a gunshot wound to the head in Chihuahua, Mexico. His widow has declared his death a suicide. Most of his family, however, cry murder and point to a number of possible suspects: his business partner, his ranch-hand, the widow herself. In \u201cThe Devil Never Sleeps,\u201d Lourdes Portillo returns to the land of her birth to find out exactly who her uncle was and to investigate the circumstances of his death. She explores \"irrational\" as well as \"logical\" explanations, searching for clues on both sides of the border and in the history of her family. Old tales of betrayal, passion, lust and supernatural visitation emerge as we follow the filmmaker deep into the life of a community in the homeland of Pancho Villa. \u201cThe Devil Never Sleeps\u201d exposes the loves and hatreds of a Mexican family convulsed by the death of one of its members. The emotions that Portillo captures in her particular blend of traditional and experimental techniques bring out the nuances of Mexican social and family order. Poetic, tragic, humorous and mythic, this film crosses the borders of personal values, cultural mores and the discipline of filmmaking itself. It is a key film by a Latina filmmaker.</p><p><strong>Freedom Riders (2010)\u00a0\u00a0 <br /></strong>During 1961, more than 400 people from across the nation, black and white, women and men, old and young, challenged state-sanctioned segregation on buses and in bus terminals in the Deep South, segregation that continued after the Supreme Court had ruled the practice to be in violation of interstate commerce laws. Some 50 years later, \u201cFreedom Riders,\u201d a two-hour PBS American Experience documentary made by Stanley Nelson, charted their course in considerable depth as they faced savage retaliatory attacks and forced a reluctant federal government to back their cause. The riveting story is told without narration using archival film and stills and, most engagingly, through testimonies of the Freedom Riders themselves, journalists who followed their trail, federal, state, and local officials, white southerners, and chroniclers of the movement including Raymond Arsenault, whose book inspired the documentary. The film takes viewers through many complex twists and turns of the journey with extraordinary clarity and emotional force. The courage and conviction of the Freedom Riders, ordinary Americans willing to risk bodily harm and death to combat injustice nonviolently, will inspire later generations who watch Nelson\u2019s eloquent film. Nearly 50 full interviews conducted for the film are now available in the American Archive of Public Broadcasting at <a href=\"https://americanarchive.org/special_collections/freedom-riders-interviews\">https://americanarchive.org/special_collections/freedom-riders-interviews</a>.</p><p><strong>Grease (1978)<br /></strong>This tuneful, loving tribute to 1950s America \u2014 perhaps more romanticized than accurate \u2014 was first staged on Broadway in 1972. A huge hit, it would run for over 3,000 performances before closing in 1980. In 1978, the production was brought to the big screen with the addition of a few fresh songs and a cast including newly-minted superstar John Travolta and pop/country chanteuse Olivia Newton-John. Energetically directed by Randal Kleiser and loaded with beloved songs like \u201cYou\u2019re the One that I Want,\u201d \u201cWe Go Together,\u201d \u201cSummer Nights,\u201d \u201cHopelessly Devoted to You\u201d and \u201cGreased Lightin\u2019,\u201d \u201cGrease\u201d became the film of that year. It has never really left \u2014 becoming a staple for both local and high school productions, several Broadway revivals and even a live TV adaptation in 2016.\u00a0 \u201cGrease\u201d is still the word.</p><p><strong>The Ground (1993-2001)<br /></strong>The films of Robert Beavers are exceptional for their visual beauty, aural texture and depth of emotional expression. Beavers\u2019 films occupy a noble place within the history of avant-garde film, positioned at the intersection of structural and lyrical filmmaking traditions. They seem to embody the ideals of the Renaissance in their fascination with perception, psychology, literature, the natural world, architectural space, musical phrasing and aesthetic beauty. \u201cThe Ground<strong><em>\u201d</em></strong> uses seemingly simple components \u2014 the sunbaked landscape of a Greek island, the blue waters of the Aegean Sea and images of a man chiseling stone \u2014 to conjure the fundamental experience of holding something close to one\u2019s heart.</p><p><strong>The Hurt Locker (2008)<br /></strong>That great Hollywood staple, the \u201cwar movie,\u201d got a major reinvention in director Kathryn Bigelow\u2019s 2008 riveting and uncompromising look at contemporary warfare. Following the work of a Baghdad-based explosive ordnance disposal team, \u201cThe Hurt Locker\u201d strips away sentiment \u2014 and politics \u2014 to\u00a0 focus its camera on the rampant, second-by-second dangers and ethical dilemmas of modern-day soldiers. Jeremy Renner leads the skillful cast as a detonation expert for whom war seems a little too \u201cnormal.\u201d Along with winning that year\u2019s Best Picture Oscar, Bigelow was named as \u201cBest Director\u201d by the Academy, the first woman to receive that honor.</p><p><strong>Illusions (1982)<br /></strong>Born in New York City, Julie Dash is a filmmaker, music video and commercial director, author and website creator. Her film studies began in Harlem in 1969 but eventually led her to the American Film Institute and UCLA, where she made \u201c<em>The Diary of an African Nun\u201d</em><em>\u00a0</em>(1977), based on a short story by Alice Walker, which won a student award from the Directors Guild of America. Dash\u2019s critically acclaimed short film \u201c<em>Illusions\u201d</em> (1982) later won the Jury Prize for Best Film of the Decade awarded by the Black Filmmakers Foundation. Created for her MFA thesis at UCLA, \u201cIllusions, is set in World War II-era Hollywood and explores the nature of Hollywood racial politics, fantasy and the illusion of racial identity.</p><p><strong>The Joy Luck Club (1993)        \u00a0 <br /></strong>Director Wayne Wang's adaptation of Amy Tan's novel tells a story of relationships between Chinese-American women and their Chinese immigrant mothers.\u00a0 The four mothers meet weekly to play Mahjong, tell stories and reminisce. The richly layered plot features key themes including the often complicated relationships between mothers and daughters, assimilation into a far different culture, wistfulness for aspects of former lifestyles, the intersections between past and present, and the strong bond of family ties between two generations who grew up in vastly different circumstances.\u00a0 Wang\u2019s film \u201cChan Is Missing\u201d was selected to the National Film Registry in 1995.</p><p><strong>Kid Auto Races at Venice (1914)</strong><br />A milestone in film history, \u201cKid Auto Races at Venice\u201d features the debut of Charlie Chaplin\u2019s little tramp character as he continually disrupts a cameraman trying to film a soapbox derby car race. A contemporary review in The Cinema noted, \"Kid Auto Races struck us as about the funniest film we have ever seen. When we subsequently saw Chaplin in more ambitious efforts, our opinion that the Keystone Company had made the capture of their career was strengthened. Chaplin is a born screen comedian; he does things we have never seen done on the screen before.\u201d</p><p><strong>Lilies of the Field (1963) <br /></strong>From 1950 to 1980, Sidney Poitier ranked among the top American film stars (\u201cNo Way Out,\u201d \u201cBlackboard Jungle,\u201d \u201cEdge of the City,\u201d \u201cThe Defiant Ones,\u201d \u201cRaisin in the Sun,\u201d \u201cParis Blues,\u201d \u201cIn the Heat of the Night,\u201d \u201cGuess Who\u2019s Coming to Dinner\u201d). In \u201cLilies,\u201d Poitier has another of his classic roles where he plays an itinerant worker who helps refugee East European nuns build a chapel in Arizona. The nuns cannot pay him for the work and implore him to do so by citing various Biblical verses (Sermon on the Mount). Poitier, for his part, is moved by their plight but also wants to demonstrate his skills as an architect and builder. The film serves as a parable highlighting mutual respect via common purpose, the austere Arizona desert landscape, the impoverished nuns, and a man they believe God sent to help them. For his portrayal, Poitier became the first African American to win the Oscar for best actor.</p><p><strong>Losing Ground (1982)     <br /></strong>One of the first feature films directed by an African American woman, Kathleen Collins\u2019 \u201cLosing Ground\u201d tells the story of a marriage between two remarkable people, both at a crossroads in their lives.\u00a0\u201cLosing Ground\u201d centers on the experiences of Sara (Seret Scott), an African American philosophy professor whose artist husband Victor (Bill Gunn) rents a country house for a month to celebrate a recent museum sale. The couple\u2019s summer idyll becomes complicated as Sara struggles to research the philosophical and religious meaning of ecstatic experience ...and to discover it for herself.</p><p><strong>The Man With the Golden Arm (1955) <br /></strong>The subject of drug addiction has been addressed in Hollywood films many times before, dating all the way back to the silent era (Kevin Brownlow\u2019s seminal \u201cBehind the Mask of Innocence\u201d chronicles these amazing early productions). But few dared to be as honest, blunt or graphic as this Otto Preminger treatment, which featured Frank Sinatra and Kim Novak. Sinatra stars as the heroin-addicted hero who, having gotten clean while in prison, now struggles to remain \u201cstraight\u201d after release. Oscar-nominated for his work in the film, Sinatra is a raw nerve in his unvarnished portrayal of a \u201cjunkie,\u201d most memorably in his brutal withdrawal scenes. Along with its still topical subject and powerful storytelling, the film is further enhanced by its eye-popping Saul Bass opening credits sequence and Elmer Bernstein\u2019s remarkable jazz score. Critic Dave Kehr has noted that \u201cOtto Preminger's 1955 adaptation of Nelson Algren's novel is something of a crossroads movie, suspended between the swirling expressionism of Preminger's early career and the balanced realism that would later become his forte.\u201d\u00a0 The film was preserved by the Academy Film Archive in 2005 with funding from the Film Foundation and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association.</p><p><strong>Mauna Kea: Temple Under Siege (2006)        <br /></strong>Produced and directed by Puhipau and Joan Lander of N\u0101 Maka o ka \u02bb\u0100ina, this documentary about the dormant volcano on the Big Island of Hawai\u2019i examines the development vs. ecological preservation battle between scientists who use the mountain summit as an astronomical observatory and Hawaiians who want the mountain preserved as a cultural landscape sacred to the Hawaiian people.</p><p><strong>Outrage (1950)<br /></strong>For a few years beginning in the late 1940s, Ida Lupino, Hollywood\u2019s only woman director of the period, made a series of distinctive films that spoke to the public\u2019s desire, she stated, \u201cto see something that fits in with their own concepts of the way people actually live in the world and the problems they must meet and overcome.\u201d In \u201cOutrage,\u201d an unblinking examination of the traumatic effects of rape on a vulnerable young woman, Lupino, an actress of consummate grace and power, masterfully employed sound and silence, light and shadow, depth of field and cutting, camera movement and careful framing to cinematically capture the psychological impact of her character\u2019s shattered world. Inspired by a question that Italian neo-realist director Roberto Rossellini posed to her at a party \u2013 \u201cWhen are you going to make pictures about ordinary people, in ordinary situations\u201d \u2013 Lupino, along with her husband Collier Young, associate producer Malvin Wald, and cinematographer Archie Stout created a series of low-budget impactful films with newfound talent, like Mala Powers, star of \u201cOutrage.\u201d Lupino\u2019s films, Martin Scorsese has observed, \u201caddressed the wounded soul and traced the slow, painful process of women trying to wrestle with despair and reclaim their lives.\u201d</p><p><strong>Shrek (2001)                                            \u00a0\u00a0 <br /></strong>Even by DreamWorks standards, the charm and magic of \u201cShrek\u201d seemed extraordinary upon its initial release almost 20 years ago \u2014 and its power has yet to diminish in the intervening years. With this story of a green-skinned, solitude-loving ogre, Shrek, who embarks on a noble quest, alongside his new friend, a lovable donkey, the film manages to be both a send-up of fairy tale tropes and an affectionate tribute to them. Entertaining and emotionally impactful at levels to be appreciated by both children and their adults, \u201cShrek\u201d was a mega-hit upon its release and has been followed by three equally enchanting sequels, a TV holiday special and a Broadway adaption. Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy and Cameron Diaz lead the strong voice cast.</p><p><strong>Suspense (1913)\u00a0\u00a0 <br /></strong>During the 1910s, women directors played a prominent role in the development of film as an art form. Chief among them was Lois Weber who was recognized alongside directors such as D.W. Griffith and Cecil B. DeMille. Weber\u2019s films often touched on controversial social issues such as poverty and contraception.\u00a0 In a 1913 Photoplay interview, Weber spoke of her desire to create films \u201cthat will have an influence for good on the public mind.\u201d In this 1913 short, \u201cA wife and her baby are alone in an isolated house when a tramp breaks in. As the wife tries to keep the invader at bay, her husband happens to telephone and learn what\u2019s happening. He scrambles to return home. He steals an idle car, and its owner, accompanied by police, race after him. We cut rapidly between the besieged mother and the husband\u2019s frantic drive, as he is in turn pursued. Just as the tramp is about to attack the wife, the husband bursts in, followed by the police. The family is saved. This is the plot of \u201cSuspense,\u201d co-directed by Lois Weber and Phillips Smalley. If the plot sounds familiar, it\u2019s probably because you know that one of D.W. Griffith\u2019s most famous films, \u201cThe Lonely Villa\u201d (1909) tells the same basic tale. So Weber and Smalley are reviving an old idea. Their task is to make it fresh. How they do so has been studied in depth by Charlie Keil in his book \u201c<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Early-American-Cinema-Transition-Supervising/dp/029917364X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1217997344&amp;sr=8-1\">Early American Cinema in Transition: Story, Style, and Filmmaking, 1907-1913</a>,\u201d wrote film historian David Bordwell.</p><p><strong>Sweet Sweetback\u2019s Baadasssss Song (1971)<br /></strong>With \u201cSweet Sweetback,\u201d director Melvin Van Peebles touched off a wave of imitative Black features, few of which matched his startling originality and fierce attacks. The story of a male \u201cperformer\u201d at a ghetto bordello and his run from the law, the film shrewdly mixes commercial ingredients and ideological intent. \u201cIt would be difficult to underestimate Melvin Van Peebles's achievement in producing, directing, writing, scoring and starring in this film, not to mention financing it with the salary he had earned while directing \u201cWatermelon Man\u201d (1970). Not since Oscar Micheaux had an African American filmmaker taken such complete control of the creative process, turning out a work so deeply connected to his own personal and cultural reality that he was not surprised when the white critical establishment professed bewilderment upon its release in 1971.

It happened in January 1973 at a Brooklyn sporting goods store, when four young Black men stealing guns for self-defense were cornered by the NYPD. A violent gun battle ensued and soon a police officer lay dead in the freezing rain. In response, hundreds of police officers poured into Williamsburg intent on carrying out what was then standard NYPD operating procedure: issue an ultimatum and then assault the store with deadly force despite hostages trapped inside.</p><p>Into this tense standoff came Harvey Schlossberg, an NYPD officer with a doctorate in psychology who had been tasked with finding a solution to the tragic hostage crises at Attica and the Munich Olympics. Schlossberg\u2019s revolutionary emphasis on communication and de-escalation put him at odds with powerful NYPD superiors but helped stave off a bloodbath and create modern hostage negotiation. Watch a short excerpt from the film <span><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/468668567\">here</a></span>.</p><p>Production on \u201cHold Your Fire\u201d began in 2014. Former New York Police Commissioner William Bratton was instrumental in granting the filmmakers unusually open access to New York City Police Department personnel and materials. Director Stefan Forbes interviewed people on all sides of the conflict, including hostages and gunmen such as Shu\u2019aib Abdur-Raheem, whose perspective sheds new light on the tense 47-hour ordeal. The documentary also features never-before-seen footage and photographs, which help illuminate this watershed event.</p><p>The award will be presented in a <span><a href=\"https://tbas.swoogo.com/prizeforfilm/662355\">virtual ceremony on </a><a href=\"https://tbas.swoogo.com/prizeforfilm/662355\">Oct. 20</a></span>.\u00a0 The ceremony will include a conversation with the Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden, Ken Burns and the composer and musician Wynton Marsalis discussing the power of storytelling and our collective history.</p><p>Established in 2019, the Library of Congress Lavine/Ken Burns Prize for Film is an annual prize that recognizes a filmmaker whose documentary uses original research and compelling narrative to tell stories that touch on some aspect of American history.\u00a0</p><p>One hundred and fifty-one films were submitted for consideration earlier this year. An internal committee consisting of filmmakers from Florentine Films and expert staff from the National Audio-Visual Conservation Center, the Library\u2019s state-of-the-art moving image and recorded sound preservation facility, reviewed the submissions. The six finalists were then reviewed by a national jury consisting of: <strong>Edward Ayers</strong>, the Tucker-Boatwright Professor of the Humanities and president emeritus at the University of Richmond; <strong>Andrew Delbanco</strong>, the Alexander Hamilton Professor of American Studies at Columbia University and president of the Teagle Foundation; <strong>Rachel Dretzin </strong>(\u201cWho Killed Malcolm X?\u201d), co-founder of Brooklyn-based Ark Media and a principal producer, director and writer with the company; <strong>Dawn Porter </strong>(\u201cJohn Lewis: Good Trouble\u201d), an American documentary filmmaker and the founder of production company Trilogy Films; and <strong>Elizabeth Coffman </strong>(\u201cFlannery\u201d), documentary filmmaker, film scholar, and inaugural recipient of the 2019 Library of Congress Lavine/Ken Burns Prize for Film.\u00a0 The Librarian of Congress, <strong>Carla Hayden</strong>, in consultation with <strong>Ken Burns</strong>, then selected the winning film.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Hold Your Fire\u2019 is an extraordinary examination of policing in America,\u201d Burns said. \u201cAs we find ourselves in the midst of reexamining the relationship between police and communities of color, this film resurfaces a critical moment in that history. I applaud Stefan and his producers Amir Soltani and Tia Wou for their masterful work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKen and I were both awed by this documentary,\u201d said Hayden, the Librarian of Congress. \u201c\u2019Hold Your Fire\u2019 is a searing and powerful look into a little-known moment in history that has profound repercussions for how we understand policing today. We are excited and proud to present the second Library of Congress Lavine/Ken Burns Prize for Film to Stefan Forbes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are honored to support this award,\u201d said philanthropists Jeannie and Jonathan Lavine, who provided the funding to The Better Angels Society to endow this award through the Crimson Lion/Lavine Family Foundation. \u201cIn a year that has been so challenging for independent filmmakers, we are thrilled to see that so many of them are still looking to history for inspiration, and creating enduring works of art with yesterday\u2019s footage, photos and songs. Steeped in storytelling, \u201cHold Your Fire\u201d embodies exactly the kinds of work we hoped to honor with this prize \u2013 it powerfully lifts up history and makes it a common ground. Congratulations to Stefan Forbes and all the recipients.\u201d</p><p>Jeannie Lavine works on several national boards, including The Better Angels Society\u2019s Board of Directors. Jonathan Lavine is the Co-Managing Partner of Bain Capital, a Co-Chair of the Trustees of Columbia University and Chair Emeritus of City Year.</p><p>\u201cWe're deeply grateful to be recognized by Dr. Hayden, Ken Burns and the panel and to be in the company of such outstanding work by fellow filmmakers\u201d Forbes said. \u201cFrom the moment we heard about this epic 1970s New York story, we were dying to track down the participants and uncover what really happened. It\u2019s been profoundly moving to meet these survivors and learn about Dr. Schlossberg\u2019s system of crisis intervention and negotiation, which is so badly needed in America today.\u201d</p><p>The Better Angels Society has supplemented the Lavines\u2019 award by providing additional awards to the Prize finalists\u2014they awarded $50,000 to \"<a href=\"https://www.curedfilm.com/\">Cured</a>,\u201d directed by Patrick Sammon and Bennett Singer, which tells the David-versus-Goliath story of the activists who challenged the automatic classification of every gay man and woman as mentally ill.

Each year, beginning in 2020, five filmmakers whose films are not selected as finalists for the Library of Congress Lavine/Ken Burns Prize for Film but who demonstrate significant potential will be selected as fellows. A panel of expert filmmakers will provide the fellows with mentorship, advice and networking opportunities around both their Library of Congress Lavine/Ken Burns Prize for Film submissions and their craft overall. Through the Fellowship Program, the Library of Congress Lavine/Ken Burns Prize for Film will foster the creation of balanced, well-researched American history documentaries, and promising independent filmmakers will receive the same kind of networking and support opportunities Ken Burns received early in his career. Jeannie and Jonathan Lavine have endowed the program with $1 million. It will run concurrently to the Library of Congress Lavine/Ken Burns Prize for Film.</p><p>Earlier this year, The Better Angels Society also announced the six winners of The Next Generation Angels Awards, an award recognizing middle and high school students for excellence in historical documentary filmmaking.

The text of the newspapers is made searchable by character recognition technology, but users looking for specific images were required to page through the individual issues. Through the creative ingenuity of Innovator in Residence Benjamin Lee and advances in machine learning, Newspaper Navigator now makes images in the newspapers searchable by enabling users to search by visual similarity.</p><p>To create Newspaper Navigator, Lee trained computer algorithms to sort through 16 million Chronicling America newspaper pages in search of photographs, illustrations, maps, cartoons, comics, headlines and advertisements. The idea for Lee\u2019s groundbreaking project began with a Library crowdsourcing experiment by 2017 Innovator in Residence Tong Wang called <a href=\"http://beyondwords.labs.loc.gov/#/\">Beyond Words</a>, which invited members of the public to help identify cartoons, illustrations, photographs and advertisements in World War I-era newspapers. Users could draw boxes around visual content on a page, transcribe captions or review other users\u2019 transcriptions.</p><p>\u201cWhen I first encountered Beyond Words, I was captivated by the thousands of photographs, illustrations, cartoons and maps identified by volunteers. I began to wonder whether this identified visual content was the key to throwing open the treasure chest of visual content throughout all 16 million pages in Chronicling America using machine learning,\u201d Lee said. He applied to the Library\u2019s <a href=\"https://labs.loc.gov/about/opportunities/innovator-in-residence-program\">Innovator in Residence</a> Program to find out.</p><p>While image searching techniques are not new from tech companies, Newspaper Navigator marries cultural heritage with computer science. Users encounter a real-time demonstration of how algorithms are trained to scan millions of pieces of data in seconds. All code used in the project is open source and placed in the public domain for unrestricted re-use. The dataset code can be accessed at <a href=\"https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/newspaper-navigator\">github.com/LibraryOfCongress/newspaper-navigator</a>.</p><p>\u201cAs I am writing a history of editors in the early United States, Newspaper Navigator will be an invaluable tool for charting the visual culture of the press,\u201d said Jim Casey, an assistant professor of African American Studies at Penn State University who was part of a test group for Newspaper Navigator. \u201cIt provides us with a wealth of clues about the work of editors (behind the scenes) to forge the look and feel of the first drafts of history. Ben Lee\u2019s work at the LC Labs is a first-rate example of how computing can help us understand our cultural heritage in new and unexpected ways. I expect that the Newspaper Navigator platform is going to open up many new areas of research because it allows us to ask new kinds of questions.\u201d</p><p>The Library\u2019s longtime collaboration with the National Endowment for the Humanities created the National Digital Newspaper Program, which produces Chronicling America.</p><p>\u201cNewspaper Navigator affords a whole new dimension of access to Chronicling America,\u201d said Molly O\u2019Hagan Hardy of the National Endowment for the Humanities. \u201cImages and words on the printed newspaper page interact to construct meaning for readers past and present, and we miss half of that meaning making when our searches rely exclusively on the written text.\u201d</p><p>Newspaper Navigator will allow greater access to a large collection and can enable new discoveries from historical newspapers, Hardy said.</p><p>\u201cWhat inspires me about Newspaper Navigator is that it\u2019s possible only through decades of collective vision and innovation,\u201d said Kate Zwaard, the director of digital strategy at the Library of Congress. \u201cBen\u2019s creative work builds on other open-source software projects, open data from Chronicling America scanned by libraries and archives across America, and the shared contributions of Beyond Words users. It allows us to see the exponential effect of sharing information and technology.\u201d</p><p>Through experimentation, research and collaboration, LC Labs works to realize the Library\u2019s vision that \u201call Americans are connected to the Library of Congress\u201d by enabling the Library\u2019s Digital Strategy.

The platform also enables the creation, translation, downloading and printing of stories through embedded tools. The repository has over 23,000 stories in 259 languages and continues to grow.</p><p>As demand surged during the pandemic for digital learning resources, Pratham Books created programs that can be used in low-resource environments, including a Learn at Home program, thematic reading lists, audio-visual books and a phone-based dial-a-story program that allows a child to locate a story in a chosen language by dialing a toll-free number.\u00a0</p><p>In addition, in just four months, StoryWeaver translated 3,000 books in 28 new languages, including books about the coronavirus, health and hygiene and social and emotional issues. UNESCO and the World Bank have listed StoryWeaver as a resource for the homebound child during the pandemic.

A 2018 Los Angeles exhibition at the Annenberg Space for Photography featured more than 400 photographs from the Library, spanning three centuries of photography. The Library is planning a future photography exhibition, based on the Annenberg-curated show from 2018, along with a documentary film on the Library of Congress and its history, produced by the Annenberg Space for Photography.</p><p>\u00a0\u201cThe nation\u2019s library is honored to have the strong support of Wallis Annenberg and the Annenberg Foundation as we enhance the experience for our visitors,\u201d said Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden. \u201cWe know that visitors will find new connections to the Library of Congress through the incredible photography collections and countless other treasures held here to document our nation\u2019s history and creativity.\u201d</p><p>To enhance the Library\u2019s holdings, the foundation is also giving the Library photographic prints for long-term preservation from 10 other exhibitions hosted at the photography museum. The Library holds one of the world\u2019s largest photography collections with about 14 million photographs and more than 1 million images digitized and available online.</p><p>\u201cI'm thrilled that we're able to make so many of the Annenberg Space for Photography\u2019s images a part of the Library\u2019s\u00a0extraordinary collection,\u201d Annenberg said. \u201cThe Photo Space was founded with a focus on the visitor experience \u2014 on\u00a0engaging our community with astonishing\u00a0works of art. So even as the Photo Space closes its doors, I feel like we're opening a new one with the Library of Congress and letting even more\u00a0people experience these stunning images.\"</p><p>Celebrating its 220<sup>th</sup> year as a center of knowledge and preservation of the nation\u2019s cultural heritage, the Library aims to bring more of its collections out of the vaults and into public spaces and online presentations.</p><p>Three core components are central to the visitor experience plan. These include a new ground-level <strong>orientation gallery</strong> in the Thomas Jefferson Building to help visitors navigate the Library and understand its history, a new <strong>learning lab</strong> to engage and inspire visitors and new exhibitions to feature the Library\u2019s <strong>treasures</strong>.</p><p>The Annenberg gift will build on the significant investments of Congress and private philanthropy in the Library\u2019s infrastructure. Earlier in 2020, philanthropist David Rubenstein announced a lead gift of $10 million to support the visitor experience plan. Design work is now underway for the project.</p><p>The visitor experience project has continued support from Congress, with $20 million appropriated so far as part of this public-private partnership.</p><p>While Congress has invested generously in the Library over its history since 1800, private philanthropy also has played an important role in the development of the Library and other cultural institutions. Private sector donors have funded exhibitions and programs, including the creation of the Library\u2019s John W. Kluge Center and Kluge Prize for Achievement in the Study of Humanity, which is currently honoring political theorist Danielle Allen, as well as creation of the Library\u2019s Packard Campus for Audio-Visual Conservation in Culpeper, Virginia.</p><p>The Library of Congress is the world\u2019s largest library, offering access to the creative record of the United States \u2014 and extensive materials from around the world \u2014 both on-site and online.

Written by Christine Acham, chair and professor at University of Hawai\u2019i at M\u0101noa\u2019s Academy for Creative Media, and Ashley Young, Ph.D. candidate in the University of Southern California's School of Cinematic Arts, the exhibit,\u00a0<a href=\"https://americanarchive.org/exhibits/black-power\">\u201cTelevising Black Politics in the Black Power Era:\u00a0Black Journal\u00a0and\u00a0Soul!\u201d\u00a0</a>chronicles how television became a tool for breaking down stereotypes and for fostering dialogue within Black communities.

By making these episodes available once again, and revealing the context in which they were produced, we hope a new generation will be inspired by the creative spirit that brought communities together in understanding,\u201d Acham said. \u201cA big thanks to the AAPB and to WNET for their preservation efforts and resurfacing these historic programs<em>.</em>\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe preservation of\u00a0\u2018Black Journal\u2019<em>\u00a0</em>for posterity is something that I am proud to have played a part in.

At the time of the Japanese surrender, Yellin was completing his 19<sup>th</sup> mission over Japan; he landed on Iwo Jima to find out the war had already been over for three hours. The loss of so many comrades in battle \u2014 16 from his squadron in total \u2014 took a toll on Yellin, and he battled post-traumatic stress disorder following the end of the war.</p><p>Another highlighted narrative is that of Mary Crawford Ragland, who served in the Women\u2019s Army Corps with the 6888<sup>th</sup> Central Postal Directory Battalion, an African-American unit known as the \u201cSix Triple Eight.\u201d Serving in Birmingham, England, and Rouen, France, Ragland and her comrades took on the job of clearing a massive backlog of personal mail sent by service personnel and stuck in limbo between the European Theater and the home front. The year 1945 brought jubilation \u2014 the Six Triple Eight marched in a victory parade down the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9e in Paris \u2014 but also exposed Ragland to the horrors of the war, such as the destruction of French villages and newly liberated concentration camps.</p><p>Congress created the Veterans History Project in 2000 to collect, preserve and make accessible the firsthand remembrances of United States veterans from World War I through the more recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, so that future generations may hear directly from veterans and better understand the realities of war.
