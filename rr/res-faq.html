      <h2 class="dot-top">Answers</h2>
           <ol>
             <li id="1"><strong>What materials are in the Library of Congress collections?</strong>
             <p>The Library has in its collections well over 100 
               million items, in hundreds of different languages and virtually 
               every format--not just books and journals, but also prints, 
               drawings, government documents, photographs, microforms, films, 
               sound and video recordings, manuscripts, and other formats. 
               As large and diverse as the Library's collections are, it 
               does not have every book ever published. While virtually all 
               subject areas are represented in the collections, the Library 
               does not attempt to collect comprehensively in the areas of 
               clinical medicine and technical agriculture, which are covered 
               by the <a

href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/">National Library of Medicine</a> and the <a

href="https://www.nal.usda.gov/">National Agricultural Library</a>, respectively. 
               Researchers should also note that the Library of Congress 
               is distinct from the <a

href="https://www.nara.gov/">National Archives</a>, which is the major repository 
             for the official records of the United States government.</p> <p class="backtotop"><a href="res-faq.html#skip_menu">Top</a></p></li>
            
             <li id="2"><strong>Where are the Library of Congress collections stored?</strong>
             <p>Because of the extraordinary size and diversity 
               of the Library's collections, there is no one place for researchers 
               to access them. Most (but not all) of the Library's collections 
               are located in the three main buildings of the Library--the 
               Thomas Jefferson Building, James Madison Building, and John 
               Adams Building--near the U.S. Capitol. (The collections of 
               the <a href="../nls.html">National Library Service for the Blind and Physically 
                 Handicapped</a> are housed elsewhere; consult their web page 
               for more information.) Researchers coming to the Library can 
               access materials in over 20 public reading rooms in the Jefferson, 
               Adams, or Madison Buildings, depending on the format, subject, 
               or language of the materials they are using. Most researchers 
               use more than one reading room during their stay here. An 
               annotated <a href="index.html">list 
                 of the Library's reading rooms</a> is available on the Library 
               of Congress website, as is the full text of <a
href="main/inforeas/index.html"><cite>Information for Researchers</cite></a>, a 
               Library publication introducing prospective researchers to 
             Library policies and services.</p> <p class="backtotop"><a href="res-faq.html#skip_menu">Top</a></p></li>
            
             <li id="3"><strong>How do I find out if the Library of 
               Congress has the materials I need?</strong> 
              <p> There is no one resource which lists all of the
               Library's holdings. Most of the Library's books, journals,
               
               and microforms from 1968 to the present are listed in the <a href="https://catalog.loc.gov/">Library of Congress Online
                 Catalog</a>. The online catalog
               also has partial 
               listings of some of the Library's non-book collections (e.g.
               manuscripts, sound recordings, sheet music), and partial
               listings 
               of pre-1968 books, journals and microforms. Library of Congress
               materials  are also listed in online bibliographic databases
               (e.g. OCLC), which are available at local libraries; consult your
               local librarians for more information on these services. </p>
               <p>Not all of the Library's collections are listed in the 
               online catalogs. The online catalog has only partial listings 
               for non-book materials, and for books and monographs older 
               than 1968. For older books, monographs, and serials, off-site 
               researchers can consult the various editions of the <cite>National 
                 Union Catalog</cite> and the <cite>National Union List of 
                   Serials</cite>, which list the holdings of many U.S. research 
               libraries including the Library of Congress. The <cite>National 
                 Union Catalog</cite> is available at many local libraries.</p>
               <p>The Library's main card catalog, which lists book and
               journal holdings to the end of 1980, is located in the <a href="main/index.html">Main
                 Reading Room</a> of the Thomas Jefferson Building (LJ
               100), and can only be searched on site. This is at present
               
               the most reliable source of information for books and journals
               older than 1968. Many of the Library's non-book materials
               
               are listed in catalogs available only in the appropriate
               Library of Congress reading room; consultation with
               reference 
               staff in the reading room is necessary to locate materials.
               A <a href="index.html">list
                 of the  Library's reading rooms</a>, with information
               about their  collections and links to their web pages,
               is available on 
               the Library of Congress website.</p><p class="backtotop"><a href="res-faq.html#skip_menu">Top</a> </p></li>
             
             <li id="4"><strong>Can I read the full text of books 
               and journals listed in the Library of Congress online catalog?</strong>
               <p>The files available through the online catalog provide 
               bibliographic information only. The full text of books and 
               journals is not available through the catalog. However, the 
               Library does make available the full text of some materials 
               via the Internet (see question "5" below).</p><p class="backtotop"><a href="res-faq.html#skip_menu">Top</a>             </p></li>
             
             <li id="5"><strong>Does the Library of Congress have the full text of any of its collections available on the Internet?</strong> 
             <p>The <a href="https://memory.loc.gov/">American
                 Memory</a> project to present digitized versions of American
               historical materials provides many examples of texts, photographs,
               sound recordings, and other materials from our collections. Many <a href="http://www.loc.gov/publish/general/">Library 
                 of Congress publications</a> are available in full text online, 
               such as the <a

href="https://memory.loc.gov/hlas/">Handbook for Latin American Studies</a> and 
               Federal Research Division <a href="http://www.loc.gov/collections/country-studies/about-this-collection/">Country 
                 Studies/Area Handbooks</a>. Some of the Library's <a

href="http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/">exhibitions</a> are also available on the
               Internet. Very occasionally, you may also find links in  catalog records to the full text of resources which have been digitized by  other institutions. However, these are only a small percentage of the
               Library's
               total holdings. Also, the Library provides full text of many <a href="http://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/bibhome.html">bibliographies 
             and guides</a> to its collections.</p>

               available at my library but is listed in the collections of 
               the Library of Congress?</strong>
             <p>Many of the items listed in the Library of Congress 
               catalogs are available in other libraries. You can ask your 
               local librarian about interlibrary loan service from participating 
               libraries. Your library may be able to borrow a book from 
               the Library of Congress provided it is not available at any 
               other libraries.</p><p class="backtotop"><a href="res-faq.html#skip_menu">Top</a></p></li>
            
             <li id="7"><strong>Can I ask reference questions of
               the  Library of Congress via email, letter, or telephone?</strong>
              <p>Yes, the following provides guidance on our policy and
               ways to communicate with us. The Library of Congress encourages
               researchers to use local library resources first. Your
               local library will often be able to respond to your query more quickly than
               the  Library of Congress, and is better able to identify
               and respond to your specific and ongoing needs. In most cases, you
               will find that the information you need is available at

              <p>With a few exceptions, the Library's collections of books, journals, and  other materials are in closed stacks, and must be retrieved.  Researchers may request materials using an  online automated call system or may fill out paper call slips to request the  materials they need. Most of the Library's general collection of books and  journals is in the closed stacks of the Jefferson and Adams Buildings;  specialized collections of books and other materials are in closed stacks in  all three main Library buildings, or are stored off-site. Delivery times vary  with the different reading rooms, ranging from a few minutes to the next  business day. You should consult the various <a href="index.html">reading room home pages</a> for more information on delivery of

               <br />
               All of the reading rooms have reference collections on 
               open shelves, where researchers may retrieve materials for 
               themselves and use them in the reading room. However, these 
               materials represent only a small fraction of the Library's

               To purchase a debit card for copying, a one-dollar bill

               addresses for books and/or journals?</strong>
              <p>Local libraries have specialized reference sources 
               in their collections which identify the addresses of publishers. 
               Speak with your local librarian for specific sources.<p class="backtotop"><a href="res-faq.html#skip_menu">Top</a></p>

               <p>The Library of Congress does not sell books from 
               its collections. See your local librarian or a book dealer 
               in your area to find information on how to purchase books; 
               or consult an online database with information on purchasing 
               books, such as <a href="https://www.bookfinder.com/" class="external">Bookfinder.com</a>. The Library does photocopy materials from its collections 
               within copyright guidelines; see above under question "20" 
               for more <a href="res-faq.html#20">information on photocopying materials</a>.

             <li id="27"><strong>Can the Library of Congress tell 
               me how much a book is worth?</strong>
             <p>The Library of Congress does not provide individuals 
               with information on the current market value of books. Such 
               a search would require extensive examination of published 
               sources, and the results would not necessarily indicate the 
               price that the item in your possession would bring in the 
               market. Standard reference sources on book prices, available 
               in most large libraries, contain records of auction sales 
               and may list pertinent transactions. See a reference librarian 
               at your local library for assistance. </p>
               <p>Many used and rare book dealers often provide valuation 
               of books. Internet book databases such as <a href="https://www.bookfinder.com/" class="external">Bookfinder.com</a>  also provide price information for used or rare books. More 
               information on rare books and book values can be found on 
               the "<a
