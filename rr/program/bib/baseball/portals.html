                  <p>A treasure trove of free baseball materials are available through the Library of Congress website. While  some of these materials are scattered throughout the site (see the <a href="https://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/baseball/features.html">Features page</a> for help locating them), several major portals, digital collections, and databases serve as gateways to the vast majority of the Library's online baseball content. These resources are described below, along with notable digital collections, databases, and catalogs not focused exclusively on baseball but which nevertheless include significant and historical primary sources about the game. Finally, this page includes a section on how to search across the Library's portals, collections, and other areas of the website for baseball resources using the Library's main search engine.</p>

                        diaries, photographs,

                    <blockquote>
                      <p>This collection from the Library's Prints &amp; Photographs Division presents a Library of Congress   treasure&mdash;2,100 early baseball cards dating from 1887 to 1914. The cards show such legendary figures as   <a href="https://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/bbc/search?co=bbc&q=Ty%20Cobb">Ty Cobb</a> stealing third base for Detroit, <a href="https://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/bbc/search?co=bbc&q=Tris%20Speaker">Tris Speaker</a> batting for Boston, and pitcher <a href="https://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/bbc/search?co=bbc&q=Cy%20Young">Cy Young</a> posing formally in his Cleveland uniform. Other notable players include <a href="https://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/bbc/search?co=bbc&q=Connie%20Mack">Connie Mack</a>, <a href="https://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/bbc/search?co=bbc&q=Walter%20Johnson">Walter Johnson</a>, <a href="https://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/bbc/search?co=bbc&q=King%20Kelly">King Kelly</a>, and <a href="https://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/bbc/search?co=bbc&q=Christy%20Mathewson">Christy Mathewson</a>.</p>
                      <p>Cigarette card collector Benjamin K. Edwards preserved these baseball   cards in albums with more than 12,000 other cards on many subjects.   After his death, Edwards' daughter gave the albums to noted poet and   Lincoln biographer Carl Sandburg, who donated them to the Library's   Prints and Photographs Division in 1954.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                      <p>This presentation features hundreds of pieces of sheet music from the Library's Music Division that reference   baseball from the late nineteenth century to the early twentieth   century.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the items shown represent the earliest   widely-distributed baseball collectibles; the value of these objects   lies both in their music and lyrics as well as in their elaborately   illustrated covers, which furnish a factual and cultural history of our   national game, its fans and their heroes. The related exhibit, <a href="https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/baseballs-greatest-hits/index.html"><em>Baseball&rsquo;s Greatest Hits: The Music of Our National Game</em></a>, helps situate this sheet music within its historical and cultural contexts.

                    <blockquote>
                      <p>The approximately 1,750 baseball scouting reports from the 1950s and 1960s presented here are part of the papers of Branch Rickey (1881-1965), best known as the executive who broke Major League Baseball's color line by signing Jackie Robinson to the Brooklyn Dodgers roster in 1947. By that date, however, Rickey had already built an impressive career as a player, manager, and baseball executive, which eventually earned him a place in the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. The scouting reports, which are located in a series of baseball files in the Rickey collection, were compiled between 1951 and 1964. They are mostly concentrated in the years 1951-1956 and 1962-1963, while Rickey was associated, respectively, with the Pittsburgh Pirates and St. Louis Cardinals.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                      <p>2007 marked the 60th anniversary of Jackie Robinson's rookie season for the Brooklyn Dodgers. When he stepped onto Ebbets field on April 15th, 1947, Robinson became the first African American in the twentieth century to play baseball in the major leagues -- breaking the &quot;color line,&quot; a segregation practice dating to the nineteenth century. Jackie Robinson was an extremely talented multi-sport athlete and a courageous man who played an active role in civil rights. This presentation was created to commemorate his achievements and describe some aspects of the color line's development and the Negro Leagues. Materials that tell his story, and the history of baseball in general, are located throughout the Library of Congress.</p>

                      <p><span class="italic">The Spalding Base Ball Guides, 1889-1939</span> comprises a historic selection of <span class="italic">Spalding&rsquo;s Official Base Ball Guide</span> and the <span class="italic">Official Indoor Base Ball Guide</span>. The collection reproduces 35 of the guides, which were published by the Spalding Athletic Company in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. <span class="italic">Spalding&rsquo;s Official Base Ball Guide</span> was perhaps the premier publication of its day for the game of baseball. It featured editorials from baseball writers on the state of the game, statistics, photographs, and analysis of the previous season for all the Major League teams and for many of the so-called minor leagues across the nation. The 15 <span class="italic">Spalding&rsquo;s Official Base Ball Guides</span> included in this online collection were published between 1889 and 1939. The <span class="italic">Official Indoor Baseball Guide</span> concerns a game unfamiliar to most contemporary baseball fans because its demise occurred almost beyond living memory. These guides, too, offer rules and &ldquo;how-to&rsquo;s&rdquo; of the game, information on the game&rsquo;s founding fathers, photographic illustrations of teams and players from across the land, and game statistics. The 20 <span class="italic">Official Indoor Base Ball Guides</span> included in this collection were published between 1903 and 1926.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                      <p>This collection presents a Library of Congress treasure -- 2,100 early baseball cards dating from 1887 to 1914. The cards show such legendary figures as  Ty Cobb stealing third base for Detroit,  Tris Speaker batting for Boston, and pitcher  Cy Young posing formally in his Cleveland uniform. Other notable players include  Connie Mack, Walter Johnson, King Kelly, and Christy Mathewson.</p>
                      <p>Cigarette card collector Benjamin K. Edwards preserved these baseball cards in albums with more than 12,000 other cards on many subjects. After his death, Edwards' daughter gave the albums to noted poet and Lincoln biographer Carl Sandburg, who donated them to the Library's Prints and Photographs Division in 1954.</p>

                  <p class="bold">Browsing by Subject and Format</p>
                  <p>Use the catalog's <a href="https://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/tgm/">online thesaurus</a> to locate appropriate subject headings <a href="https://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/tgm/search?q=baseball&amp;co=tgm">related to baseball</a>. Each subject heading is hyperlinked; selecting the heading will result in the display of all images under that heading in the catalog. Examples of headings include <a href="https://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/tgm/item/tgm000828/">baseball</a>, <a href="https://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/tgm/item/tgm000831/">baseball players</a>, and <a href="https://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/tgm/item/tgm000830/?sid=5c99b974b55625793e847088d0be4ac4">baseball managers</a>. </p>
                  <p>The catalog also includes a <a href="https://www.loc.gov/pictures/index/subjects/">subject browse</a> option through which users can browse headings for baseball-related subject headings.</p>
                  <p>Users should also check the bibliographic records of relevant images to see whether they have been assigned subject headings. These subject headings will also be hyperlinked and will lead to other images assigned the same heading. For example, <a href="https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/92507380/?sid=8cc66ae4a1c3ce80f95a48db1abb7ba4">this image of Babe Ruth</a> includes two relevant subject headings, <a href="https://www.loc.gov/pictures/related/?q=Ruth%2C%20Babe%2C--1895-1948.&amp;fi=subject">Ruth, Babe,--1895-1948</a>, and <a href="https://www.loc.gov/pictures/related/?q=Baseball%20players--1920.&amp;fi=subject">Baseball players--1920</a>, that will lead to other images or Ruth and baseball players from the 1920s, respectively.</p>
                  <p>Users can browse the collections of Prints and Photographs Online Catalog <a href="https://www.loc.gov/pictures/index/formats/">by format</a> as well. Baseball-related formats that can be searched include:</p>

                  <p>Finally, several selections of baseball images from the Prints and Photographs Division can be found through <a href="https://www.loc.gov/rr/print/list/picamer/paSpbase.html" class="italic">Pictorial Americana</a>, an online version of a 1955 Library publication.</p>
                  <p>Images available within the Prints and Photographs Online Catalog, along with additional images found in image-based collections available through divisions through the Library, can also be searched through the <a href="https://www.loc.gov/photos/collections/?st=gallery">Library-wide digital collections interface</a>.

                  <p>Most of the Library's free online portals, collections, and databases, with the major expection of the <a href="portals.html#chron"><em>Chronicling America</em> historic newspapers database</a>, can searched through the Library's primary search engine, located on the Library's home page as well as at <a href="https://www.loc.gov/search/">https://www.loc.gov/search/</a>.</p>
                  <p>The Library's search engine takes advantage of &quot;faceted searching,&quot; which allows users to  refine the results of an initial keyword search, or to browse for content, using various categories of information (facets) related to items in the Library's physical and online collections. To view available facets, go to <a href="https://www.loc.gov/search/">https://www.loc.gov/search/</a> and examine the options in the &quot;Refine your results&quot; column at the left of the page:</p>
                  <blockquote>

                  </blockquote>
                  <p>Major facets available include Original Format; Online Format; Date;  Location; Part of; Contributor; Subject;  Language; and Access Condition. Under each major facet are numerous, more specific facets that you can select to narrow a results set. The default for search results is to display materials available online. Select &quot;All Items&quot; to change the list of results to include records for items in the Library's physical collections as well.</p>
                  <p class="bold">Browsing by Facet for Baseball Materials</p>
                  <p>When using the main search page to locate baseball materials, you do no need to enter an initial keyword search in order to begin refining results by facet. You can immediately start browsing by facet and locate materials without ever needing to conduct a keyword search.</p>
                  <p>The most important major facet for identifying baseball-related material on the Library's website is the Subject facet:</p>
                  <p align="center"><img src="subject.jpg" width="410" height="426"  alt=""/></p>
                  <p>Select &quot;<a href="https://www.loc.gov/search/index/subject/">More Subjects</a>&quot; at the bottom of this facet to open up a larger list of subjects:</p>
                  <p align="center"><a href="https://www.loc.gov/search/index/subject/"><img src="more_subjects.jpg" width="566" height="385"  alt=""/></a></p>
                  <p>This larger list of subjects is arranged by number of matches, from the subject with the most available items to the subject with the least. You can browse this list to find subjects related to baseball&mdash;select &quot;Alphabetically&quot; to search for subjects that begin with a specific word or phrase, such as <em><a href="https://www.loc.gov/search/index/subject/?q=&sb=index&fp=Ruth%2C+Babe">Ruth, Babe</a></em>. Searching alphabetically on &quot;Baseball&quot; will bring you to a <a href="https://www.loc.gov/search/?fa=subject%3Asongs+and+music|subject%3Abaseball&dates=1908">page listing all subjects that begin with that term</a>:</p>
                  <p align="center"><a href="https://www.loc.gov/search/index/subject/?q=&sb=index&fp=Baseball"><img src="subjects_beginning_baseball.jpg" width="689" height="447"  alt=""/></a></p>
                  <p>You can select a specific heading to be brought to a list of items assigned it.</p>
                  <p><span class="bold">Searching by Keyword, then Refining by Facet</span></p>
                  <p>Rather than beginning your search by using the &quot;Refine your results&quot; facts, you can begin with a keyword search and then refine the results returned by facet. For example, you can search across the Library's website on the keyword <em>baseball</em> by entering the term into the search box at the top the main search page (or other Library pages):</p>
                  <p align="center"><img src="baseball_keyword_search.jpg" width="669" height="256"  alt=""/></p>
                  <p>The results page will return a list of items available online that include the term <em>baseball</em> in their records or full text. If you want to see a list of subjects assigned to all of these matching items, find the &quot;Subject&quot; facet under the &quot;Refine Your Results&quot; options and select &quot;More Subjects.&quot; Here is the resulting page:</p>
                  <p align="center"><img src="subjects_for_baseball.jpg" width="592" height="393"  alt=""/></p>
                  <p>The default arrangement is by number of matching items, though the list can be sorted alphabetically as well. Once you find a subject in which you are interested, select it to be brought to a list of items on the Library's website assigned that subject that also include a match on the keyword <em>baseball</em>. For example, if you are interested in baseball songs and music, select the <a href="https://www.loc.gov/search/?fa=subject%3Abaseball|subject%3Asongs+and+music"><em>Songs and Music</em></a> heading:</p>
                  <p align="center"><img src="songs_and_music_heading.jpg" width="613" height="181"  alt=""/></p>
                  <p>This will bring you to a <a href="https://www.loc.gov/search/?q=baseball&fa=subject%3Asongs+and+music">results page</a> listing items in the online collection that include a match on the keyword <em>baseball</em> and have been assigned the subject <em>Songs and Music</em>:</p>
                  <p align="center"><a href="https://www.loc.gov/search/?q=baseball&fa=subject%3Asongs+and+music"><img src="keyword_refined_by_subject.jpg" width="671" height="321"  alt=""/></a></p>
                  <p>You can browse this list of results or resort them using the &quot;View&quot; option. If you want to further refine your results, you can again use the  facets available from the &quot;Refine your results&quot; column at the left. For instance, if you want to narrow your results to songs published in 1908, go to the Date facet and <a href="https://www.loc.gov/search/?fa=subject%3Abaseball|subject%3Asongs+and+music&amp;dates=1900-1999">select &quot;1900-1999&quot;</a>:</p>
                  <p align="center"><img src="date_by_century.jpg" width="407" height="150"  alt=""/></p>
                  <p>Once you select this date range, the facets listed under Date will automatically adjust to present a refined list of dates from which to choose, this time by decade:</p>
                  <p align="center"><img src="date_by_decade.jpg" width="402" height="253"  alt=""/></p>
                  <p>When you choose a decade, the list will again be refined, this time by individual year. After <a href="https://www.loc.gov/search/?q=baseball&fa=subject%3Asongs+and+music&dates=1900-1909">selecting &quot;1900 to 1909&quot;</a> you can then choose <a href="https://www.loc.gov/search/?q=baseball&fa=subject%3Asongs+and+music&dates=1908">&quot;1908 to 1908&quot;</a> from the more refined list of Date facets to be brought to the one item in our online collections that matches a search for items published in 1908  assigned the subject <em>Songs and Music</em> and whose text or record includes the keyword <em>baseball</em>:</p>
                  <p align="center"><a href="https://www.loc.gov/search/?q=baseball&fa=subject%3Asongs+and+music&dates=1908"><img src="keyword_refined_by_sub_and_date.jpg" width="656" height="258"  alt=""/></a></p>
                  <p class="bold">Granular Searching by Facet</p>
                  <p>When searching or limiting results by facet, keep in mind that the same facet, such as Date or Subject, can often be refined multiple times.  For example, if you begin you search by limiting content to the <a href="https://www.loc.gov/search/?fa=subject%3Abaseball">subject <em>Baseball</em></a>, you can return to the Subject facet to find a newly refined list of subject facets will include more granular subjects from which to choose:</p>
                  <p align="center"><img src="baseball_subject_granular.jpg" width="322" height="342"  alt=""/></p>
                  <p>Clicking on the <a href="https://www.loc.gov/search/index/subject/?fa=subject%3Abaseball">&quot;More Subjects&quot; link</a> will open the complete listing of  refined subject facets from which you can choose. You can refine results by two, three, or more Subject facets, and combine that search with other facets (e.g., Location and Date) as you browse for content.</p>
                  <p>Leveraging the power of faceted searching from the Library's <a href="https://www.loc.gov/search/">faceted search home page</a>, as well from the main <a href="https://www.loc.gov/search/index/subject/?fa=subject%3Abaseball">Subject page for baseball</a>, you can quickly and efficiently mine much of the Library's online baseball-related content to find exactly the types of resources in which you are interested.</p>
