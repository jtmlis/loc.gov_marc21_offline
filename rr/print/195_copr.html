        an image that I've found in the P&amp;P
        collections?</h2>
      <p>The
        answer to this question involves considering
        other
        questions:</p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li><strong>What do you know about the rights
          associated with the image?</strong> <span class="linksmall">[<a href="195_copr.html#rights">more

          and</li>
        <li> <strong>How do you plan to use
            the image?</strong>
          (For instance,
          if your use falls under the &quot;fair use&quot;
          clause in the copyright law, copyright
          will be less of an issue, though you
          will need to pay attention to any donor
          restrictions) <span class="linksmall">[<a href="195_copr.html#use">more
          about this</a>]</span></li>
      </ol>
      <p>Sometimes the answer is very clear. Other
        times the answer isn't clear at all. </p>
      <p><strong>In
          all cases, it is the researcher's obligation
          to determine and satisfy copyright or
          other use restrictions when publishing
          or otherwise distributing materials
        found in the Library's collections.</strong></p>
      <h3><a name="rights"></a>1a. What do you know about the rights
        associated with the image?</h3>
      <p>When the Prints &amp; Photographs
        Division has information about the rights
        associated
        with an image or a collection of images,
        it conveys that information to researchers
        through catalog records and/or rights
        statements.</p>
      <p>Can you find:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>An
                associated catalog record (text

                statements written by P&amp;P
                for specific collections or artists
                are available online.  Look on
            the <a href="res/rights.html">Rights

            or search in the site search box on

                  <li> the collection from which

                  <li> the artist who made it.</li>
	        </ul>
			    <p>If there is no rights statement
        for a collection, we may not have analyzed
        it yet. The information below is intended
                to help you interpret the language
                found in rights and restrictions
                statements.</p>
			    <ul>
			      <li><p> If images were copyrighted and
                copyright has expired, we say &#8220;Images
                in this collection are considered

                <em>Example:</em><br>
                <img src="images/corCurtissm.jpg" alt="Edward Curtis example rights statement" width="600" height="154" class="example">                <br><a href="https://www.loc.gov/rr/print/res/369_curt.html" class="linksmall">[view

	                the criteria for the &quot;no known
	                restrictions&quot; designation,
	                we say &quot;no known restrictions&quot;
	                in the rights and restrictions
	                statement (see
                  information about the meaning

		          <li> <p>If images have been placed
		              in the public domain by
		              the creator or rights holder,
		              we say that the images are
		              in the public domain in
		              the rights and restrictions
		              statement.<br>

		          <li>
		            <p>If images are restricted and
              the Library has information on how
		                  to contact the rights holder
		                  for permission,
		                  we provide
              that information. <br>

	              </li>
		          <li>If the donor of the collection
		            has specified restrictions, we provide
		            that information.
					<ul>
                    <li>Sometimes the donor&#8217;s
                      restriction is on a certain
                      type of use. <em>Example</em>: LOOK
                      Magazine Photograph Collection
                      [<a href="https://www.loc.gov/rr/print/res/074_look.html">view
                      statement</a>]</li>
                    <li> 
                      Sometimes the donor has
                      specified the length of
                      time that the collection
                      is restricted. <em>Example</em>:
                          Brigitte Stelzer [<a href="https://www.loc.gov/rr/print/res/295_stel.html">view
                      statement</a>]</li>
                    </ul>
		          <br></li>
		          <li>
		          <p>Rights statements are sometimes
            confusing because images within a
		            collection were sometimes
		            made or gathered under
            varying circumstances. While the vast
            majority of images in a collection
		            may be analyzed one way, there
		            may be exceptions, and a few
		            images may be analyzed another
		            way.</p>

		    <p>Evaluating the rights status

		        pretty straightforward when the

		        the copyright registration number
		              and date is found on the
		      image or in the catalog record that
		      describes it. </p>

		            with copyright date and copyright

		    <p>To determine whether
		        you can get copyright information
		        if it is <strong>not</strong> in the
		        catalog record or on the item,
		        you can </p>
		    <ul>
		      <li> search the records of
              the U.S. Copyright Office yourself,
		        or</li>
	          <li>hire
                someone to perform a search 
	            [see, for example, <a href="https://www.loc.gov/rr/print/resource/013_pic.html#copyright">P&amp;P's
              list of searchers</a>] or </li>
		      <li>pay the Copyright Office for
              a search. </li>
	        </ul>
		    <p>Copyright registrations from 1978 to the present can be searched online (see: &quot;<a href="https://copyright.gov/records/voyager_tutorial.pdf">Guide to Searching the Copyright Office Catalog</a>&quot; [pdf]). Further information about copyright searching
		       is available in U.S. Copyright

                22</a> [pdf], "How to Investigate the
                Copyright Status of a Work," and

                be considered conclusive
              but will show a good faith effort. </p>
		    <p>If you find copyright registration information,
		      the next step is to determine how

		      Copyrights Last</a>,

The item will enter the public domain on January 1 of that year [see #1 in the chart of examples below].</p>
				  <p><span class="textsmall"> <em>Note</em>: Starting in the late 1990s and up until 2019, a key date for assessing copyright in the U.S. was the year 1923. That was because, according to the Copyright
		          Act of 1976, works registered
		          for copyright or published with
		          a copyright notice were protected
		          for a maximum
		          of 75 years
		          of copyright protection, assuming
		          the copyrights on the works
		          were renewed (28 years first term
		          plus
		          47 for
		          the
		          second, if renewed). Public
		          Law 105-298 enacted in October 1998
		          increased the
		          maximum to 95 years [28 years
		          first term and 67 for the second,
		          if renewed].
		          Before 1998 the longest amount
		          of time a work could be protected
		          was 75 years,
		          so works before 1923 were no
		          longer
		          protected (1998 minus 75 years
		          equals 1923). When the law changed,
		          the 1923
		          date was "frozen" and
		          remained so until January 1, 2019.  </span></p>

		           <em>Note about copyright notices</em>: For  some pre-1989 works, publication without a copyright notice may mean  that the item is in the public domain. The  criterion of the copyright notice is easy enough to apply to books, but a bit  tricky with images, since the original work may have had a copyright notice  that was not reproduced on subsequent copies or the copyright may have been on  the work in which the image appeared, rather than on the image itself. &nbsp;Images without a copyright notice may still be  under copyright. The U.S. Copyright Office&nbsp;<u><a href="https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ03.pdf">Circular  3</a></u>&nbsp;[pdf; 125 kb],  &quot;Copyright Notice&quot; explains the notice requirements for works  published between January 1, 1978, and February 28, 1989 and provides a  reference for locating information on the requirements prior to 1978.                                    </p>

            <h5><a name="orphan"></a>Situations Where There is Simply Insufficient
		      Information</h5>
		    <p>Unfortunately, many P&amp;P images lack
		      information on the image or associated
		      with
		      the image (particularly the date
		      of creation or the name of the individual
		      or
		      firm that created the image) to
		      help with rights evaluation. </p>
		    <p><em>Example:</em> <img src="images/corNoInfosm.jpg" width="600" height="148" class="example" alt="Sample catalog record for item which lacks creator or rights holder identification"><br>
  Masterpieces of Art building, New York World's
    Fair, 1939-1940<br>
		    </p>
		    These  images, sometimes called &quot;orphan
		    works,&quot; are the most vexing to researchers
		      trying to determine rights. You
		      will need to consider what you know
		      about when and why
		      the image was created, what you
		      plan to use the image for, and then
		      assess the risk of using it for
		      that purpose.
		    <ul>
		      <li>
		        <p> Request a <a href="195_copr.html#search">copyright
		            search</a>, even
		          if you have little information
		          to go on. The paperwork from
		          the Copyright Office could show
		          your good faith effort to establish
		          the rights status of the image.</p>
		      </li>
	          <li>	            Record the type of
	            searching you have done and what
	            you did or didn't find, so you
	            can demonstrate you used due diligence
	            in
	          searching for the rights holder. </li>
	        </ul>
		    <p>It may or may not help to know that the
		      problem is so vexing that the U.S.
		      Copyright Office recently
		      opened an examination of issues
		      related to orphan works, which
		      it defined as those whose owners
		      are difficult or even impossible
		      to locate.

                        where
                        restrictions might apply;
                        with these collections,
                        no one has
                        ever successfully claimed
                such rights.<br>
                Examples:<ul>
              <li>Farm Security

            <p>While the overwhelming majority
              of images that display jpegs and
              tiffs off-site fall into the first
              three categories, be sure
              you haven&#8217;t
              wandered into one of the few collections
              in the fourth category. Moreover,
              although the fact that jpegs/tiffs
              display off-site may offer some
              clues as
              to the rights status of an image,
              you  will still need to make
              your own
              determination. As always, you need
              to consider the rights issues, incuding
              copyright, <a href="195_copr.html#privacy">privacy,
