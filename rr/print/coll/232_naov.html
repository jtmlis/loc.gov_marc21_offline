                <H2>Overview</H2>
                <p>The Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division preserves
                and makes available more than 17,000 pictorial records of native
                peoples made chiefly by European and Euro- American artists and
                photographers. Most of these have documentary importance; some
                are also important to the artistic development of graphic art
                and photography.
                </p>
                <P> More than three-quarters of the Division's images are photographs.
                  Other material includes drawings, engravings, lithographs,
                  posters, and architectural drawings. While pictorial material
                  relating to the American Indian was produced as early as the
                  fifteenth century, the Prints and Photographs Division's holdings
                  in this area are strongest for the period 1860 to 1940. Many
                  of these images came to the Library through copyright. Other
                  works have been obtained through gift, purchase, transfer from
                  other federal agencies, and exchange. </p>
                <P>Many images can be viewed 
                   through the <a href="https://www.loc.gov/pictures/">Prints and Photographs Online
                  Catalog</a> using the standard subject heading <em>Indians of North America</em>. For a more detailed discussion of Prints &amp; Photographs Division collections that are strong for images of American Indians and how to search for the images, see a guide compiled in 2018: <a href="http://guides.loc.gov/native-american-pictures">Native American History and Culture: Finding Pictures</a>.</p>
<P>  To make full use of the collections, a personal
                    visit is recommended. <A href="https://www.loc.gov/rr/print/info/001_ref.html#distance">Limited
                    service from a distance</A> is also available.
                Quality copies can be purchased  through the Library's <A href="https://www.loc.gov/duplicationservices/">Duplication Services</A>.</p>

                
            <H2>Major Categories</H2>
               <p>The Division's holdings document several major aspects of the
                history and life of native peoples, and the conventions of their
                depictions:

                      the earliest true portraits of Native Americans are those
                      made of tribal leaders or delegates who visited European
                      capitals and Washington, D.C. for diplomatic purposes.
                      These visits and visitors, as well as Indian-white relations
                      such as treaty negotiations, legal affairs, land claims,
                      and protests, are well documented in lithographs, drawings,
                      studio portraits, posters, and photographic prints.

                      largely characterized by hostility and violence, causing
                      the term "Indian wars" to gain wide currency. Artists portrayed
                      these bloody conflicts, sometimes literally and sometimes
                      imaginatively, in drawings, prints, and in illustrations
                      for popular newspapers and magazines. Because of limited
                      technology, photographers were limited to documenting the
                      grim aftermath of skirmishes, tribal leaders and combatants,
                      battle sites, and other stationary subjects such as forts
                      and military equipment. The Division's holdings reflect

                 <BLOCKQUOTE>Historian William H. Goetzmann offers social commentary
                  on about one hundred fifty images of Native Americans from
                  the Prints and Photographs Division, most of which were taken
                  by turn-of-the-century commercial photographers. Investigating
                  the photographers themselves, Goetzmann questions how their
                  perceptions of American Indians, as well as what was marketable,
                  influenced the visual
records they made.</BLOCKQUOTE>
