Better known as Lewis Carroll, the Victorian-era children&rsquo;s  author of <em>Alice&rsquo;s Adventures in Wonderland</em> (1865) and <em>Through the Looking-Glass</em> (1871),  Dodgson was a lecturer in mathematics at the University of Oxford. The scrapbook contains  approximately 130 items, including newspaper clippings, photographs, and a limited number  of manuscript materials, collected between 1855-72. A timeline, authored by Edward Wakeling,  former chairman of the Lewis Carroll Society, helps to place materials found in the scrapbook  in their proper context. </p> <p>Lewis Carroll is the pseudonym for the Reverend Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (1832-1898),  lecturer of mathematics at Oxford University, England. He is best known as the  author of <em>Alice&rsquo;s Adventures in Wonderland</em>, a Victorian Era children&rsquo;s  story. The Lewis Carroll Scrapbook in the Rare Book &amp; Special Collections  Division of the Library of Congress consists of one scrapbook of approximately  200 unnumbered pages, containing 142 pasted and inlaid items. Carroll appears  to have kept the scrapbook between the years 1855 and 1871. Of the approximately  200 unnumbered pages, only 63 pages contain clippings and writing, the remaining  pages are blank.

His most notable feat was circumnavigating the earth from 1577-80, the first such voyage since Magellan's in 1522 and the only one up to that time captained by the same man from start to finish. Drake's expeditions to the Caribbean and the Pacific, undertaken during the circumnavigation and in subsequent voyages, revealed significant new geographical data about the New World and added greatly to Queen Elizabeth I's [1533-1603] treasury.</p>  <h2>The Collector</h2> <p>Assembled by Hans Peter Kraus and his wife Hanni in only twelve years, these materials reveal a great breadth and scope in the primary and secondary materials that concern Sir Francis Drake. Kraus was one of the foremost booksellers of the second half of the twentieth century. Born in Austria in 1907, he exhibited a precocious mind and a love of collecting from an early age\u2014which soon turned to a love of collecting books. He became a bookseller under the traditional antiquarian Austrian guild system\u2014first becoming an apprentice. In 1939, during the Nazi Occupation, Kraus and his family fled Austria for the United States. Within two weeks of his arrival in New York, Kraus met Hanni, his future wife and business partner. The couple established an antiquarian bookselling firm, H. P. Kraus, Inc., and amassed the stock and the connections needed for success. Their legendary firm opened in the early 1940s and did not close until 2003. The firm collected and sold many first rate editions.</p> <h2>The Collection</h2>  <p>In a 1968 James Ford Bell Lecture, Kraus explained how a chance comment about the enormous profit reaped by Sir Francis Drake and Queen Elizabeth from the around-the-world voyage piqued his interest and led him to study Drake's life. The more that Kraus learned, the more fascinated he became, and he resolved to put together a collection of contemporary materials related to Drake and his journeys. In 1980 Hans and Hanni Kraus generously donated their collection to the Rare Book and Special Collections Division of the Library of Congress. The combination of the Library's other rich collections from this period and the resources of the neighboring Folger Shakespeare Library make Washington a preeminent center for the study of the Elizabethan era.  The Kraus Collection consists of 60 items--16 manuscripts, 29 books, 8 maps and views, and 7 medals and portraits. The materials range in date from 1579 to 1765 and are written in English, Spanish, Latin, Italian, German, French, and Dutch.</p> <h3>Manuscripts</h3>  <p>Manuscripts range in date from 1579 to 1603. They are mostly correspondence between various governing officials and diplomats of the Spanish and English crowns regarding Drake's activities in Spanish America and are written in Spanish, English, Latin, and Italian. Many of the other documents concern legal or financial topics, including the record of Drake's sale of a 71-year lease of a house called the &quot;The Herbar.&quot;</p> <h3>Books</h3>  <p>Books range in date from 1581 to 1695 and are published in Spanish, English, Latin, German, French, and Dutch. Topics include general histories of exploration, trade, and navigation on the high seas including Drake's circumnavigation of the world. Other topics are of a more political nature and either extol Drake's accomplishments or decry his plunders in Spanish America. Still other accounts are biographies of the crowned heads Queen Elizabeth I and King Philip II [1527-1598].</p> <h3>Maps and views</h3>  <p>Maps and views range in date from 1570 to 1765 and were created by Spanish, Belgian, and English cartographers. Spanish America is depicted with drawings of fortresses and harbors as well as with maps of St. Augustine, South America, and the West Indies. There are also drawings depicting the Spanish Armada and the sea battles between the Spanish and the English. There is also a map of the world with an engraving of Drake and a map of Devonshire, England.</p> <h3>Medals and Portraits</h3>  <p>Medals and portraits range in date from 1583 to 1598 and are English, Spanish, and Dutch in origin. Two engraved medals commemorate the defeat of the Spanish Armada and two medals by Michael Mercator depict engravings of the world. There is also an engraving of Drake on paper, a series of portraits of sea explorers, and an oil portrait of Lord William Cecil Burghley, Queen Elizabeth I's secretary from 1558 to 1572.</p>"], "digitized": true, "extract_timestamp": "2020-12-18T06:31:03.468Z", "group": ["collections-portal"], "hassegments": false, "id": "http://international.loc.gov/intldl/drakehtml/rbdkhome.html", "image_url": ["https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/sir-francis-drake/155_155.jpg#h=155&w=155", "https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/sir-francis-drake/500_500.jpg#h=500&w=500"], "index": 2, "item": {"call_number": ["DA86.22.D7"], "contributors": ["Hans and Hanni Kraus Sir Francis Drake Collection (Library of Congress)", "Library of Congress."], "date": "2005", "format": ["text"], "language": ["eng"], "location": ["Great Britain", "Spain"], "notes": ["access level test"], "subjects": ["Drake, Francis,--approximately 1540-1596--Sources", "Explorers--Great Britain", "Explorers--Spain", "Great Britain--History, Naval--Tudors, 1485-1603", "Great Britain--History--Elizabeth, 1558-1603", "Hans and Hanni Kraus Sir Francis Drake Collection (Library of Congress)"], "summary": ["Sir Francis Drake, English explorer and naval strategist, circumnavigated the earth from 1577-1580.

The researcher may encounter duplicate or multiple cards for some of the non-English recordings in this catalog.

In the United  States, however, between about 1850 and 1920, a heightened conservation  consciousness first emerged as a complex, broadly popular political and  cultural movement, based largely on a growing appreciation among  newly-urbanized Americans for the importance of nature as an economic,  aesthetic, and spiritual resource, together with a newly urgent  conviction that nature's resources were increasingly imperilled.  This  movement led to unprecedented public and private initiatives intended to  ensure the wise and scientific use of natural resources, and the  preservation of wildlife and of landscapes of great natural beauty. </p> <p> From the vantage point of the end of the twentieth century, it is  perhaps natural to regard the development of conservation stewardship as  a single discernible movement in American history, one which came of  age in the decades between 1850 and 1920, though it has continued to  expand and evolve in vital ways in the decades ever since.  To the  cultural historian probing the components of this movement, however, its  unity, and hence its inevitable coming of age in the nation's  consciousness, are far less clear.  On the contrary, what is most  striking is the eclectic nature of the historical trends and cultural  attitudes which coalesced in the development of conservation thought and  policy.  This collection of materials from the Library of Congress  reflects the conservation movement's complexity and heterogeneity. </p> <p> At the broadest level, the development of at least three distinct but  interlocking imperatives guided Americans' re-conception of their  relation to their natural environment in the 1850-1920 era, forming the  basic themes that find endless variation in the materials of this  collection: </p> <ul>  <li><strong>Scientific and technological concerns</strong>, including recognition of the human impact on the natural environment, and faith in the human capacity to manage that impact actively and wisely for human benefit;</li>  <li><strong>Philosophical, ethical, and spiritual values and symbolizations</strong>, including those which linked American \"nature\" to the construction of American national identity and character, and redefined the natural world as a moral and spiritual resource for urban and industrial man; </li>  <li><strong>Aesthetic considerations</strong>, including those which celebrated the perception and enjoyment of wildlife, wilderness, and natural beauty as legitimate and necessary recreational resources in American life. </li> </ul> <p>These fundamental preoccupations intersected with a cluster of deep  historical transformations--the triumph of large-scale  industrialization, urbanization, full-fledged commercial agriculture and  natural-resource extraction--all of which amounted to a fourth  formative pattern in the culture of the age: </p> <blockquote>  <p><strong>A profound revision in the man-land and man-nature relationships which had subsisted in America since the European settlement.</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>The development of conservation thought and policy may be traced from  these structural and ideological roots as they ramified throughout  American life to manifest themselves in a host of related phenomena,  including the following: </p> <blockquote>  <p>... a perceived crisis in American national identity and purpose,  expressed in part in the popularity of the \"Turner thesis\" (named for  the historian who developed it, Frederick Jackson Turner), which located  the source of American identity in the pioneer encounter with the  wilderness frontier, and deemed that frontier now \"closed\"</p>  <p> ... expressions of anti-urbanism and anti-modernism among intellectuals and the elite </p>  <p> ... the transformation of the old American pastoral/agrarian ideology  into the new suburban ideal, with its accoutrements of landscape  gardening, country clubs, summer camps, etc. </p>  <p> ... the burgeoning interest in camping and \"woodcraft\" as resources for  recreation and character development, especially for boys, and the  resulting formation of scouting organizations </p>  <p> ... the use of nature as an instrument of education and socialization,  as in the urban parks and playgrounds movement, and the movement for  \"nature study\" in schools </p>  <p> ... the development of landscape architecture as a profession </p>  <p> ... the intellectual mastery of the American landscape and its  resources, particularly in the West, attained by the body of  explorations and surveys in the later decades of the nineteenth century  that brought to a close white men's centuries-long calculation of the  continent </p>  <p> ... the use of photography to fix the image and identity of the  American landscape, especially in the \"wilderness\" west, in the  post-Civil War years </p>  <p> ... the practice of academic (but broadly popular) landscape painting  in the second half of the nineteenth century as a self-conscious  instrument marrying science, spirituality, and the celebration of the  American landscape as the source of the nation's moral identity </p>  <p> ... the development of scenic tourism by railway and (eventually) by  automobile, and the growing recognition of its economic importance </p>  <p> ... the growth of travel literature celebrating natural beauty and the pleasures of wild places </p>  <p> ... a growing body of reflective and analytical writings exploring man's relationship with nature </p>  <p> ... the proliferation of nature essays and nature-based fiction and  poetry in popular periodicals and books, with their implicit perception  of nature as a locus of moral authority </p>  <p> ... the sentimental celebration of nature as a theme in popular music and amateur painting </p>  <p> ... the growth of leisure time for the new urban and suburban middle  class, a function of the diminished temporal demands of  industrially-related as opposed to agricultural labor </p>  <p> ... the growth of hiking, mountaineering, angling, and game-hunting as  recreational activities, and the proliferation of amateur clubs to  sustain them </p>  <p> ... upper-class sportsmen's increasing concern about dwindling game  populations, and their readiness to exercise decisive leadership in many  aspects of the movement to conserve natural resources </p>  <p> ... the growth of \"birding\" as a popular hobby, and the proliferation  of amateur ornithological clubs and bird sanctuaries, whose sponsors  also moved quickly into positions of leadership in conservation advocacy </p>  <p> ... the consequent origins of what the historian Stephen R. Fox calls  the \"radical amateur\" tradition which led the development of American  conservationism into the 1960s </p>  <p> ... debate over the use, control, and distribution of the nation's remaining public lands and their resources </p>  <p> ... growing recognition of the disastrous consequences of deforestation, particularly in the eastern United States </p>  <p> ... increasing public anxiety over the perceived waste of the nation's natural endowment </p>  <p> ... ascendant confidence in the authority of science to guide human  knowledge and action, and in the power of technology to solve human  problems </p>  <p> ... the creative influence of scientists and engineers on the development of government policy concerning natural resources </p>  <p> ... the development of the Progressive Movement, with its characteristic faith in rational public management. </p> </blockquote> <p> These phenomena unfolded at a time in American history when the  now-familiar boundaries between amateur and professional science,  between science and religion, and between elite and popular culture were  in many ways far less fixed than they have since become.  Liberally  educated individuals could still speak with authority on scientific  matters, scientific investigation could still be construed as a  complement to religious faith, and instruments of cultural expression  commonly crossed class lines.  These factors, too, complexified the  historical ferment within which conservationism found its beginnings. </p> <p> From this milieu emerged the first great public accomplishments of the  American conservation movement, a constellation of projects in many  areas of the nation's life, devised on widely varying principles for  widely varying ends, that nevertheless succeeded in significantly  reorienting public policy and popular awareness toward the imperatives  of collective stewardship exercised on a scale unprecedented in the  history of the nation and, in some respects, the world.  Between 1850  and 1920, American conservationists invented the idea of the national  park and developed the national park system, establishing an  international model for the preservation of natural beauty and  wilderness; they instituted the practice of scientific forestry on a  broad scale in North America, adopted the principles of forestry as  government policy, established the national forest system, and founded  the Forest Service; they undertook large-scale technological management  of natural resources as a socially beneficent public objective, notably  through irrigation development; they passed state and Federal  legislation to protect certain classes of wildlife, and established a  system of national wildlife refuges; they participated in the beginnings  of systematic effort to control the impact of environmental pollution  on human health and welfare, especially in urban areas; they established  Arbor Day and Bird Day observances as a means of cultivating widespread  conservation awareness and individual conservation effort, especially  among school-children; and they supported President Theodore Roosevelt's  identification of conservation as a central object of national policy.   Even their divisions became definitive: the controversy over San  Francisco's proposal to dam Yosemite's Hetch Hetchy Valley galvanized  public consciousness of conservation issues, and crystallized the  tension between utilitarians and preservationists that has defined the  terms of conservation debate into the late twentieth century. </p> <p> For all its complexities and contradictions, for all its bargains with  greed and expedience and its failures of will or of vision (all of which  are, of course, easier to discern in the luxury of historical  hindsight), the early American conservation movement left a formidable  legacy.  At a time of revolutionary change and conflict in American  society, conservationists reasserted the moral obligation human beings  have to one another in their use of the natural world, and established  that obligation as a primary principle of the nation's public life.  At a  time when fewer and fewer of their fellow-citizens found their identity  in the soil, conservationists reconfigured the character of Americans'  moral relationship with nature.  Most fundamentally, perhaps, those who  shaped the early American conservation movement recovered for their  nation the abiding truth that what is human and what is natural are  parts of a single whole, and devised a repertoire of formal structures  and cultural strategies for giving that insight creative and enduring  form.  The materials in this collection are one measure of that  achievement. </p>"], "digitized": true, "extract_timestamp": "2020-12-18T06:32:30.409Z", "group": ["collections-portal"], "hassegments": false, "id": "http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amrvhtml/conshome.html", "image_url": ["https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/evolution-of-the-conservation-movement/155_155.jpg#h=155&w=155", "https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/evolution-of-the-conservation-movement/500_500.jpg#h=500&w=500"], "index": 5, "items": "http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amrvhtml/conshome.html", "location": ["united states"], "original_format": ["collection", "book", "photo, print, drawing", "manuscript/mixed material"], "other_title": [], "partof": ["the evolution of the conservation movement", "law library of congress", "manuscript division", "prints and photographs division", "digital collections", "geography and map division"], "shelf_id": "http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amrvhtml/conshome.html", "subject": ["government, law & politics", "science & technology", "american history"], "subject_topic": ["science & technology", "american history", "government, law & politics"], "timestamp": "2020-12-18T08:06:15.579Z", "title": "The Evolution of the Conservation Movement", "url": "//memory.loc.gov/ammem/amrvhtml/conshome.html"}, {"_partof": "prairie settlement: nebraska photographs and family letters, 1862-1912", "access_restricted": false, "aka": ["http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/award98/nbhihtml/pshome.html", "http://www.loc.gov/collections/nebraska/", "http://lccn.loc.gov/00528680", "http://www.loc.gov/item/00528680/", "http://www.loc.gov/resource/collgdc.gc000020/", "http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.gdc/collgdc.gc000020"], "campaigns": [], "contributor": ["butcher, solomon d.

Many new technologies and the new concept of scientific management in the work place had evolved during the first two decades of the century. In the 1920s these combined with an ability to produce and distribute goods on a mass scale amid widespread electrification of plants, factories, and households. These conditions led to a stabilization of the post-World War I economy that brought prosperity to many sectors.</p> <p>The materials in this digital collection highlight on the one hand business concerns, such as advertising, marketing, merchandising, and industrialization; and on the other popular notions about responsible consumerism, thriftiness, and efficiency in the home. The collection also focuses on President Coolidge's idea of government and on Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover's standardization initiatives. Lastly, the materials document groups that did not participate fully in the emergent consumer economy, notably farmers, both white and black, and immigrants. Far from exhaustive on any subject, the collection nonetheless suggests connections among some of the key technological developments, government structures, social organizations, and cultural assumptions that worked together to reinforce the mass-consumer economy.</p> <p>The themes of the collection were identified by the American Memory project team in collaboration with Library of Congress staff members and an advisory panel of historians. After reviewing the 1920s materials available at the Library, the project team selected materials for digitization from: the Manuscript Division, for personal and organizational papers; the General Collections, for books and periodicals; the Prints and Photographs Division, for photographs; and the Motion Picture, Broadcasting, and Recorded Sound Division, for films and recorded speeches.

It was  marked by massive European immigration and major population shifts  between regions of the  country, including migration from rural to urban centers that led to the  dramatic growth of cities.   During these fifty years, the nation's urban population increased from a  total of less than ten  million to more than fifty million people.  Blue-collar and white-collar  working people alike  benefited from an increase in personal income and leisure time.  Tourism  developed as an  American pastime, annual vacations became a national habit, and city  dwellers began taking half-holidays on Saturday.  Public amusements  appealed to growing numbers of people from many  walks of life.</p>   <p>Popular, live entertainment gained momentum in the late nineteenth century and reached  a peak in the first decade of the twentieth.  During the fifty-year period covered by this  collection, minstrel shows were eclipsed by the unprecedented success of variety theater and an  ever-increasing diversity of popular entertainment.  Burlesque developed into a full-fledged  theatrical form and modern amusement parks attracted huge crowds.  In 1909, for example,  Coney Island drew over 20 million visitors.  (After adjusting for population differentials, this is a  greater number than the combined attendance at Disneyland and Disney World in 1989.)        World's fairs, the three-ring circus, nightclubs, and the ballpark also flourished.  Theatrical road       shows traveled into the American hinterlands.  The cinema was born.</p> <p>The American Variety Stage Collection features materials that illustrate the diverse forms of variety theater that dominated the burgeoning entertainment world in the United States.  Variety stage, in this era, drew greater audiences than the \"legitimate\" theater which presented serious literary works.  Compared to the legitimate theater, which appealed, for the most part, to elite audiences, the variety stage was democratic and broad in approach.  The variety stage strove to attract all classes of people from every cultural background by offering varied programs and relatively low admission fees.</p> <p>To succeed at show business (as all forms of variety theater were called), entrepreneurs  provided public entertainment that transcended the specific tastes of a particular class or ethnicity.  It emphasized action and caricature.  Nevertheless, however broad or vulgar its humor,      it sought an aura of moral respectability.  Even burlesque shows attempted to do this by billing  themselves  as \"vaudeville\" and \"extravaganza\" and playing in theaters that had previously been  certified as \"respectable.\" </p> <figure  class='image-align-right'><a href=\"/item/var95-000382/\"><img      src=\"/static/collections/vaudeville-and-popular-entertainment/images/s1751701.jpg\"      width=\"150\" alt=\"\" /></a>     <figcaption><a href=\"/item/var95-000382/\">The Lone Hand Four Aces</a></figcaption> </figure> <p>Of all the types of variety entertainment, comedy is the best represented in this collection.   The English-language playscripts provide a wealth of information about what audiences found  amusing, or at least what writers thought the audience would find funny.  One can also learn  about such things as comedic techniques used, the structure of comic sketches, subjects used for  comedic purposes, and how material was customized for specific entertainers.  As well, the  collection can help shed light on the ways that vaudevillians tried to deal with contemporary  topics and concerns, especially those that now seem inappropriate (such as ethnic stereotypes,  gender and race prejudices, etc.), a topic that is especially ripe for study.</p> <p> Comedians often migrated, along with their jokes and skits, from minstrelsy to  vaudeville, from burlesque to recordings, to radio, and even to television.  Veteran performers  such as Bob Hope, George Burns, and Milton Berle have credited their early days in variety for  their subsequent success.</p> <p> The variety theater, in its most inclusive sense,  provided the American public with a  range of live entertainment:  comedy, musical presentations, novelty and specialty acts, stage magic, and stage spectacles.  American musical comedy was also in its formative stages during the fifty-year period covered by this collection.  Many early musical comedies of the period were glorified variety shows, more akin to European operettas than to what we now think of as musical comedy.

His most notable feat was circumnavigating the earth from 1577-80, the first such voyage since Magellan's in 1522 and the only one up to that time captained by the same man from start to finish. Drake's expeditions to the Caribbean and the Pacific, undertaken during the circumnavigation and in subsequent voyages, revealed significant new geographical data about the New World and added greatly to Queen Elizabeth I's [1533-1603] treasury.</p>  <h2>The Collector</h2> <p>Assembled by Hans Peter Kraus and his wife Hanni in only twelve years, these materials reveal a great breadth and scope in the primary and secondary materials that concern Sir Francis Drake. Kraus was one of the foremost booksellers of the second half of the twentieth century. Born in Austria in 1907, he exhibited a precocious mind and a love of collecting from an early age\u2014which soon turned to a love of collecting books. He became a bookseller under the traditional antiquarian Austrian guild system\u2014first becoming an apprentice. In 1939, during the Nazi Occupation, Kraus and his family fled Austria for the United States. Within two weeks of his arrival in New York, Kraus met Hanni, his future wife and business partner. The couple established an antiquarian bookselling firm, H. P. Kraus, Inc., and amassed the stock and the connections needed for success. Their legendary firm opened in the early 1940s and did not close until 2003. The firm collected and sold many first rate editions.</p> <h2>The Collection</h2>  <p>In a 1968 James Ford Bell Lecture, Kraus explained how a chance comment about the enormous profit reaped by Sir Francis Drake and Queen Elizabeth from the around-the-world voyage piqued his interest and led him to study Drake's life. The more that Kraus learned, the more fascinated he became, and he resolved to put together a collection of contemporary materials related to Drake and his journeys. In 1980 Hans and Hanni Kraus generously donated their collection to the Rare Book and Special Collections Division of the Library of Congress. The combination of the Library's other rich collections from this period and the resources of the neighboring Folger Shakespeare Library make Washington a preeminent center for the study of the Elizabethan era.  The Kraus Collection consists of 60 items--16 manuscripts, 29 books, 8 maps and views, and 7 medals and portraits. The materials range in date from 1579 to 1765 and are written in English, Spanish, Latin, Italian, German, French, and Dutch.</p> <h3>Manuscripts</h3>  <p>Manuscripts range in date from 1579 to 1603. They are mostly correspondence between various governing officials and diplomats of the Spanish and English crowns regarding Drake's activities in Spanish America and are written in Spanish, English, Latin, and Italian. Many of the other documents concern legal or financial topics, including the record of Drake's sale of a 71-year lease of a house called the &quot;The Herbar.&quot;</p> <h3>Books</h3>  <p>Books range in date from 1581 to 1695 and are published in Spanish, English, Latin, German, French, and Dutch. Topics include general histories of exploration, trade, and navigation on the high seas including Drake's circumnavigation of the world. Other topics are of a more political nature and either extol Drake's accomplishments or decry his plunders in Spanish America. Still other accounts are biographies of the crowned heads Queen Elizabeth I and King Philip II [1527-1598].</p> <h3>Maps and views</h3>  <p>Maps and views range in date from 1570 to 1765 and were created by Spanish, Belgian, and English cartographers. Spanish America is depicted with drawings of fortresses and harbors as well as with maps of St. Augustine, South America, and the West Indies. There are also drawings depicting the Spanish Armada and the sea battles between the Spanish and the English. There is also a map of the world with an engraving of Drake and a map of Devonshire, England.</p> <h3>Medals and Portraits</h3>  <p>Medals and portraits range in date from 1583 to 1598 and are English, Spanish, and Dutch in origin. Two engraved medals commemorate the defeat of the Spanish Armada and two medals by Michael Mercator depict engravings of the world. There is also an engraving of Drake on paper, a series of portraits of sea explorers, and an oil portrait of Lord William Cecil Burghley, Queen Elizabeth I's secretary from 1558 to 1572.</p>"], "digitized": true, "extract_timestamp": "2020-12-12T06:30:33.336Z", "group": ["collections-portal"], "hassegments": false, "id": "http://international.loc.gov/intldl/drakehtml/rbdkhome.html", "image_url": ["https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/sir-francis-drake/155_155.jpg#h=155&w=155", "https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/sir-francis-drake/500_500.jpg#h=500&w=500"], "index": 2, "item": {"call_number": ["DA86.22.D7"], "contributors": ["Hans and Hanni Kraus Sir Francis Drake Collection (Library of Congress)", "Library of Congress."], "date": "2005", "format": ["text"], "language": ["eng"], "location": ["Great Britain", "Spain"], "notes": ["access level test"], "subjects": ["Drake, Francis,--approximately 1540-1596--Sources", "Explorers--Great Britain", "Explorers--Spain", "Great Britain--History, Naval--Tudors, 1485-1603", "Great Britain--History--Elizabeth, 1558-1603", "Hans and Hanni Kraus Sir Francis Drake Collection (Library of Congress)"], "summary": ["Sir Francis Drake, English explorer and naval strategist, circumnavigated the earth from 1577-1580.

Lomax and Alan Lomax's Library of Congress collecting work (Leadbelly, Woody Guthrie, Jelly Roll Morton), and Alan Lomax's less well-known field collections in Haiti in 1936 to 1937 and in the upper Midwest of the United States in 1938. There are hundreds of well-known and lesser-known treasures by other notable collectors including Herbert Halpert, Zora Neale Hurston, Henrietta Yurchenco, Vance Randolph, and Helen Creighton, among many others. The catalog also reflects exchange projects with institutions outside the United States, notably the Discoteca P\u00fablica Municipal de S\u00e3o Paulo Collection (1938-1943) of field recordings from Brazil; and field recordings collected in Oceania. The researcher may encounter duplicate or multiple cards for some of the non-English recordings in this catalog. The researcher should also be aware that for some non-English recordings from this period, no cards were made. We hope to expand the catalog in the future and add the bibliographic data for the sound recordings that are now represented only as \"Spanish\" or \"Foreign.\"</p> <p>The physical card catalog in the Archive is searchable only by title, performer, state (if U.S.), shelflist number (AFS number), or country/language (other than English). The online version of the catalog searches these areas, plus recording dates, recordist's names, and many others. Our plans are to continue to increase access to individually recorded items in our collections and to grow this database beyond just the cards represented in this online catalog to other collections in the Archive.</p> <p>Please note that this catalog represents only a portion of our recordings; in fact the majority of the Archive's recordings are not represented here. There is also information in the catalog that is incorrect and incomplete. We are continually working to make these corrections, and to add more material to the database.

In the United  States, however, between about 1850 and 1920, a heightened conservation  consciousness first emerged as a complex, broadly popular political and  cultural movement, based largely on a growing appreciation among  newly-urbanized Americans for the importance of nature as an economic,  aesthetic, and spiritual resource, together with a newly urgent  conviction that nature's resources were increasingly imperilled.  This  movement led to unprecedented public and private initiatives intended to  ensure the wise and scientific use of natural resources, and the  preservation of wildlife and of landscapes of great natural beauty. </p> <p> From the vantage point of the end of the twentieth century, it is  perhaps natural to regard the development of conservation stewardship as  a single discernible movement in American history, one which came of  age in the decades between 1850 and 1920, though it has continued to  expand and evolve in vital ways in the decades ever since.  To the  cultural historian probing the components of this movement, however, its  unity, and hence its inevitable coming of age in the nation's  consciousness, are far less clear.  On the contrary, what is most  striking is the eclectic nature of the historical trends and cultural  attitudes which coalesced in the development of conservation thought and  policy.  This collection of materials from the Library of Congress  reflects the conservation movement's complexity and heterogeneity. </p> <p> At the broadest level, the development of at least three distinct but  interlocking imperatives guided Americans' re-conception of their  relation to their natural environment in the 1850-1920 era, forming the  basic themes that find endless variation in the materials of this  collection: </p> <ul>  <li><strong>Scientific and technological concerns</strong>, including recognition of the human impact on the natural environment, and faith in the human capacity to manage that impact actively and wisely for human benefit;</li>  <li><strong>Philosophical, ethical, and spiritual values and symbolizations</strong>, including those which linked American \"nature\" to the construction of American national identity and character, and redefined the natural world as a moral and spiritual resource for urban and industrial man; </li>  <li><strong>Aesthetic considerations</strong>, including those which celebrated the perception and enjoyment of wildlife, wilderness, and natural beauty as legitimate and necessary recreational resources in American life. </li> </ul> <p>These fundamental preoccupations intersected with a cluster of deep  historical transformations--the triumph of large-scale  industrialization, urbanization, full-fledged commercial agriculture and  natural-resource extraction--all of which amounted to a fourth  formative pattern in the culture of the age: </p> <blockquote>  <p><strong>A profound revision in the man-land and man-nature relationships which had subsisted in America since the European settlement.</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>The development of conservation thought and policy may be traced from  these structural and ideological roots as they ramified throughout  American life to manifest themselves in a host of related phenomena,  including the following: </p> <blockquote>  <p>... a perceived crisis in American national identity and purpose,  expressed in part in the popularity of the \"Turner thesis\" (named for  the historian who developed it, Frederick Jackson Turner), which located  the source of American identity in the pioneer encounter with the  wilderness frontier, and deemed that frontier now \"closed\"</p>  <p> ... expressions of anti-urbanism and anti-modernism among intellectuals and the elite </p>  <p> ... the transformation of the old American pastoral/agrarian ideology  into the new suburban ideal, with its accoutrements of landscape  gardening, country clubs, summer camps, etc. </p>  <p> ... the burgeoning interest in camping and \"woodcraft\" as resources for  recreation and character development, especially for boys, and the  resulting formation of scouting organizations </p>  <p> ... the use of nature as an instrument of education and socialization,  as in the urban parks and playgrounds movement, and the movement for  \"nature study\" in schools </p>  <p> ... the development of landscape architecture as a profession </p>  <p> ... the intellectual mastery of the American landscape and its  resources, particularly in the West, attained by the body of  explorations and surveys in the later decades of the nineteenth century  that brought to a close white men's centuries-long calculation of the  continent </p>  <p> ... the use of photography to fix the image and identity of the  American landscape, especially in the \"wilderness\" west, in the  post-Civil War years </p>  <p> ... the practice of academic (but broadly popular) landscape painting  in the second half of the nineteenth century as a self-conscious  instrument marrying science, spirituality, and the celebration of the  American landscape as the source of the nation's moral identity </p>  <p> ... the development of scenic tourism by railway and (eventually) by  automobile, and the growing recognition of its economic importance </p>  <p> ... the growth of travel literature celebrating natural beauty and the pleasures of wild places </p>  <p> ... a growing body of reflective and analytical writings exploring man's relationship with nature </p>  <p> ... the proliferation of nature essays and nature-based fiction and  poetry in popular periodicals and books, with their implicit perception  of nature as a locus of moral authority </p>  <p> ... the sentimental celebration of nature as a theme in popular music and amateur painting </p>  <p> ... the growth of leisure time for the new urban and suburban middle  class, a function of the diminished temporal demands of  industrially-related as opposed to agricultural labor </p>  <p> ... the growth of hiking, mountaineering, angling, and game-hunting as  recreational activities, and the proliferation of amateur clubs to  sustain them </p>  <p> ... upper-class sportsmen's increasing concern about dwindling game  populations, and their readiness to exercise decisive leadership in many  aspects of the movement to conserve natural resources </p>  <p> ... the growth of \"birding\" as a popular hobby, and the proliferation  of amateur ornithological clubs and bird sanctuaries, whose sponsors  also moved quickly into positions of leadership in conservation advocacy </p>  <p> ... the consequent origins of what the historian Stephen R. Fox calls  the \"radical amateur\" tradition which led the development of American  conservationism into the 1960s </p>  <p> ... debate over the use, control, and distribution of the nation's remaining public lands and their resources </p>  <p> ... growing recognition of the disastrous consequences of deforestation, particularly in the eastern United States </p>  <p> ... increasing public anxiety over the perceived waste of the nation's natural endowment </p>  <p> ... ascendant confidence in the authority of science to guide human  knowledge and action, and in the power of technology to solve human  problems </p>  <p> ... the creative influence of scientists and engineers on the development of government policy concerning natural resources </p>  <p> ... the development of the Progressive Movement, with its characteristic faith in rational public management. </p> </blockquote> <p> These phenomena unfolded at a time in American history when the  now-familiar boundaries between amateur and professional science,  between science and religion, and between elite and popular culture were  in many ways far less fixed than they have since become.  Liberally  educated individuals could still speak with authority on scientific  matters, scientific investigation could still be construed as a  complement to religious faith, and instruments of cultural expression  commonly crossed class lines.  These factors, too, complexified the  historical ferment within which conservationism found its beginnings. </p> <p> From this milieu emerged the first great public accomplishments of the  American conservation movement, a constellation of projects in many  areas of the nation's life, devised on widely varying principles for  widely varying ends, that nevertheless succeeded in significantly  reorienting public policy and popular awareness toward the imperatives  of collective stewardship exercised on a scale unprecedented in the  history of the nation and, in some respects, the world.  Between 1850  and 1920, American conservationists invented the idea of the national  park and developed the national park system, establishing an  international model for the preservation of natural beauty and  wilderness; they instituted the practice of scientific forestry on a  broad scale in North America, adopted the principles of forestry as  government policy, established the national forest system, and founded  the Forest Service; they undertook large-scale technological management  of natural resources as a socially beneficent public objective, notably  through irrigation development; they passed state and Federal  legislation to protect certain classes of wildlife, and established a  system of national wildlife refuges; they participated in the beginnings  of systematic effort to control the impact of environmental pollution  on human health and welfare, especially in urban areas; they established  Arbor Day and Bird Day observances as a means of cultivating widespread  conservation awareness and individual conservation effort, especially  among school-children; and they supported President Theodore Roosevelt's  identification of conservation as a central object of national policy.   Even their divisions became definitive: the controversy over San  Francisco's proposal to dam Yosemite's Hetch Hetchy Valley galvanized  public consciousness of conservation issues, and crystallized the  tension between utilitarians and preservationists that has defined the  terms of conservation debate into the late twentieth century. </p> <p> For all its complexities and contradictions, for all its bargains with  greed and expedience and its failures of will or of vision (all of which  are, of course, easier to discern in the luxury of historical  hindsight), the early American conservation movement left a formidable  legacy.  At a time of revolutionary change and conflict in American  society, conservationists reasserted the moral obligation human beings  have to one another in their use of the natural world, and established  that obligation as a primary principle of the nation's public life.  At a  time when fewer and fewer of their fellow-citizens found their identity  in the soil, conservationists reconfigured the character of Americans'  moral relationship with nature.  Most fundamentally, perhaps, those who  shaped the early American conservation movement recovered for their  nation the abiding truth that what is human and what is natural are  parts of a single whole, and devised a repertoire of formal structures  and cultural strategies for giving that insight creative and enduring  form.  The materials in this collection are one measure of that  achievement. </p>"], "digitized": true, "extract_timestamp": "2020-12-12T06:31:48.212Z", "group": ["collections-portal"], "hassegments": false, "id": "https://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amrvhtml/conshome.html", "image_url": ["https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/evolution-of-the-conservation-movement/155_155.jpg#h=155&w=155", "https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/evolution-of-the-conservation-movement/500_500.jpg#h=500&w=500"], "index": 5, "items": "https://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amrvhtml/conshome.html", "location": ["united states"], "original_format": ["collection", "book", "photo, print, drawing", "manuscript/mixed material"], "other_title": [], "partof": ["the evolution of the conservation movement", "law library of congress", "manuscript division", "prints and photographs division", "digital collections", "geography and map division"], "shelf_id": "https://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amrvhtml/conshome.html", "subject": ["government, law & politics", "science & technology", "american history"], "subject_topic": ["science & technology", "american history", "government, law & politics"], "timestamp": "2020-12-12T07:42:20.828Z", "title": "The Evolution of the Conservation Movement", "url": "//memory.loc.gov/ammem/amrvhtml/conshome.html"}, {"_partof": "prairie settlement: nebraska photographs and family letters, 1862-1912", "access_restricted": false, "aka": ["https://memory.loc.gov/ammem/award98/nbhihtml/pshome.html", "https://www.loc.gov/collections/nebraska/", "http://lccn.loc.gov/00528680", "https://www.loc.gov/item/00528680/", "https://www.loc.gov/resource/collgdc.gc000020/", "http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.gdc/collgdc.gc000020"], "campaigns": [], "contributor": ["butcher, solomon d.

Many new technologies and the new concept of scientific management in the work place had evolved during the first two decades of the century. In the 1920s these combined with an ability to produce and distribute goods on a mass scale amid widespread electrification of plants, factories, and households. These conditions led to a stabilization of the post-World War I economy that brought prosperity to many sectors.</p> <p>The materials in this digital collection highlight on the one hand business concerns, such as advertising, marketing, merchandising, and industrialization; and on the other popular notions about responsible consumerism, thriftiness, and efficiency in the home. The collection also focuses on President Coolidge's idea of government and on Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover's standardization initiatives. Lastly, the materials document groups that did not participate fully in the emergent consumer economy, notably farmers, both white and black, and immigrants. Far from exhaustive on any subject, the collection nonetheless suggests connections among some of the key technological developments, government structures, social organizations, and cultural assumptions that worked together to reinforce the mass-consumer economy.</p> <p>The themes of the collection were identified by the American Memory project team in collaboration with Library of Congress staff members and an advisory panel of historians. After reviewing the 1920s materials available at the Library, the project team selected materials for digitization from: the Manuscript Division, for personal and organizational papers; the General Collections, for books and periodicals; the Prints and Photographs Division, for photographs; and the Motion Picture, Broadcasting, and Recorded Sound Division, for films and recorded speeches.

It was  marked by massive European immigration and major population shifts  between regions of the  country, including migration from rural to urban centers that led to the  dramatic growth of cities.   During these fifty years, the nation's urban population increased from a  total of less than ten  million to more than fifty million people.  Blue-collar and white-collar  working people alike  benefited from an increase in personal income and leisure time.  Tourism  developed as an  American pastime, annual vacations became a national habit, and city  dwellers began taking half-holidays on Saturday.  Public amusements  appealed to growing numbers of people from many  walks of life.</p>   <p>Popular, live entertainment gained momentum in the late nineteenth century and reached  a peak in the first decade of the twentieth.  During the fifty-year period covered by this  collection, minstrel shows were eclipsed by the unprecedented success of variety theater and an  ever-increasing diversity of popular entertainment.  Burlesque developed into a full-fledged  theatrical form and modern amusement parks attracted huge crowds.  In 1909, for example,  Coney Island drew over 20 million visitors.  (After adjusting for population differentials, this is a  greater number than the combined attendance at Disneyland and Disney World in 1989.)        World's fairs, the three-ring circus, nightclubs, and the ballpark also flourished.  Theatrical road       shows traveled into the American hinterlands.  The cinema was born.</p> <p>The American Variety Stage Collection features materials that illustrate the diverse forms of variety theater that dominated the burgeoning entertainment world in the United States.  Variety stage, in this era, drew greater audiences than the \"legitimate\" theater which presented serious literary works.  Compared to the legitimate theater, which appealed, for the most part, to elite audiences, the variety stage was democratic and broad in approach.  The variety stage strove to attract all classes of people from every cultural background by offering varied programs and relatively low admission fees.</p> <p>To succeed at show business (as all forms of variety theater were called), entrepreneurs  provided public entertainment that transcended the specific tastes of a particular class or ethnicity.  It emphasized action and caricature.  Nevertheless, however broad or vulgar its humor,      it sought an aura of moral respectability.  Even burlesque shows attempted to do this by billing  themselves  as \"vaudeville\" and \"extravaganza\" and playing in theaters that had previously been  certified as \"respectable.\" </p> <figure  class='image-align-right'><a href=\"/item/var95-000382/\"><img      src=\"/static/collections/vaudeville-and-popular-entertainment/images/s1751701.jpg\"      width=\"150\" alt=\"\" /></a>     <figcaption><a href=\"/item/var95-000382/\">The Lone Hand Four Aces</a></figcaption> </figure> <p>Of all the types of variety entertainment, comedy is the best represented in this collection.   The English-language playscripts provide a wealth of information about what audiences found  amusing, or at least what writers thought the audience would find funny.  One can also learn  about such things as comedic techniques used, the structure of comic sketches, subjects used for  comedic purposes, and how material was customized for specific entertainers.  As well, the  collection can help shed light on the ways that vaudevillians tried to deal with contemporary  topics and concerns, especially those that now seem inappropriate (such as ethnic stereotypes,  gender and race prejudices, etc.), a topic that is especially ripe for study.</p> <p> Comedians often migrated, along with their jokes and skits, from minstrelsy to  vaudeville, from burlesque to recordings, to radio, and even to television.  Veteran performers  such as Bob Hope, George Burns, and Milton Berle have credited their early days in variety for  their subsequent success.</p> <p> The variety theater, in its most inclusive sense,  provided the American public with a  range of live entertainment:  comedy, musical presentations, novelty and specialty acts, stage magic, and stage spectacles.  American musical comedy was also in its formative stages during the fifty-year period covered by this collection.  Many early musical comedies of the period were glorified variety shows, more akin to European operettas than to what we now think of as musical comedy.

The scrapbook contains  approximately 130 items, including newspaper clippings, photographs, and a limited number  of manuscript materials, collected between 1855-72. A timeline, authored by Edward Wakeling,  former chairman of the Lewis Carroll Society, helps to place materials found in the scrapbook  in their proper context. </p> <p>Lewis Carroll is the pseudonym for the Reverend Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (1832-1898),  lecturer of mathematics at Oxford University, England.

His most notable feat was circumnavigating the earth from 1577-80, the first such voyage since Magellan's in 1522 and the only one up to that time captained by the same man from start to finish. Drake's expeditions to the Caribbean and the Pacific, undertaken during the circumnavigation and in subsequent voyages, revealed significant new geographical data about the New World and added greatly to Queen Elizabeth I's [1533-1603] treasury.</p>  <h2>The Collector</h2> <p>Assembled by Hans Peter Kraus and his wife Hanni in only twelve years, these materials reveal a great breadth and scope in the primary and secondary materials that concern Sir Francis Drake. Kraus was one of the foremost booksellers of the second half of the twentieth century. Born in Austria in 1907, he exhibited a precocious mind and a love of collecting from an early age\u2014which soon turned to a love of collecting books. He became a bookseller under the traditional antiquarian Austrian guild system\u2014first becoming an apprentice. In 1939, during the Nazi Occupation, Kraus and his family fled Austria for the United States. Within two weeks of his arrival in New York, Kraus met Hanni, his future wife and business partner. The couple established an antiquarian bookselling firm, H. P. Kraus, Inc., and amassed the stock and the connections needed for success. Their legendary firm opened in the early 1940s and did not close until 2003. The firm collected and sold many first rate editions.</p> <h2>The Collection</h2>  <p>In a 1968 James Ford Bell Lecture, Kraus explained how a chance comment about the enormous profit reaped by Sir Francis Drake and Queen Elizabeth from the around-the-world voyage piqued his interest and led him to study Drake's life. The more that Kraus learned, the more fascinated he became, and he resolved to put together a collection of contemporary materials related to Drake and his journeys. In 1980 Hans and Hanni Kraus generously donated their collection to the Rare Book and Special Collections Division of the Library of Congress. The combination of the Library's other rich collections from this period and the resources of the neighboring Folger Shakespeare Library make Washington a preeminent center for the study of the Elizabethan era.  The Kraus Collection consists of 60 items--16 manuscripts, 29 books, 8 maps and views, and 7 medals and portraits. The materials range in date from 1579 to 1765 and are written in English, Spanish, Latin, Italian, German, French, and Dutch.</p> <h3>Manuscripts</h3>  <p>Manuscripts range in date from 1579 to 1603. They are mostly correspondence between various governing officials and diplomats of the Spanish and English crowns regarding Drake's activities in Spanish America and are written in Spanish, English, Latin, and Italian. Many of the other documents concern legal or financial topics, including the record of Drake's sale of a 71-year lease of a house called the &quot;The Herbar.&quot;</p> <h3>Books</h3>  <p>Books range in date from 1581 to 1695 and are published in Spanish, English, Latin, German, French, and Dutch. Topics include general histories of exploration, trade, and navigation on the high seas including Drake's circumnavigation of the world. Other topics are of a more political nature and either extol Drake's accomplishments or decry his plunders in Spanish America. Still other accounts are biographies of the crowned heads Queen Elizabeth I and King Philip II [1527-1598].</p> <h3>Maps and views</h3>  <p>Maps and views range in date from 1570 to 1765 and were created by Spanish, Belgian, and English cartographers. Spanish America is depicted with drawings of fortresses and harbors as well as with maps of St. Augustine, South America, and the West Indies. There are also drawings depicting the Spanish Armada and the sea battles between the Spanish and the English. There is also a map of the world with an engraving of Drake and a map of Devonshire, England.</p> <h3>Medals and Portraits</h3>  <p>Medals and portraits range in date from 1583 to 1598 and are English, Spanish, and Dutch in origin. Two engraved medals commemorate the defeat of the Spanish Armada and two medals by Michael Mercator depict engravings of the world. There is also an engraving of Drake on paper, a series of portraits of sea explorers, and an oil portrait of Lord William Cecil Burghley, Queen Elizabeth I's secretary from 1558 to 1572.</p>"], "digitized": true, "extract_timestamp": "2020-11-14T06:28:46.712Z", "group": ["collections-portal"], "hassegments": false, "id": "http://international.loc.gov/intldl/drakehtml/rbdkhome.html", "image_url": ["https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/sir-francis-drake/155_155.jpg#h=155&w=155", "https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/sir-francis-drake/500_500.jpg#h=500&w=500"], "index": 2, "item": {"call_number": ["DA86.22.D7"], "contributors": ["Hans and Hanni Kraus Sir Francis Drake Collection (Library of Congress)", "Library of Congress."], "date": "2005", "format": ["text"], "language": ["eng"], "location": ["Great Britain", "Spain"], "notes": ["access level test"], "subjects": ["Drake, Francis,--approximately 1540-1596--Sources", "Explorers--Great Britain", "Explorers--Spain", "Great Britain--History, Naval--Tudors, 1485-1603", "Great Britain--History--Elizabeth, 1558-1603", "Hans and Hanni Kraus Sir Francis Drake Collection (Library of Congress)"], "summary": ["Sir Francis Drake, English explorer and naval strategist, circumnavigated the earth from 1577-1580.

In the United  States, however, between about 1850 and 1920, a heightened conservation  consciousness first emerged as a complex, broadly popular political and  cultural movement, based largely on a growing appreciation among  newly-urbanized Americans for the importance of nature as an economic,  aesthetic, and spiritual resource, together with a newly urgent  conviction that nature's resources were increasingly imperilled.  This  movement led to unprecedented public and private initiatives intended to  ensure the wise and scientific use of natural resources, and the  preservation of wildlife and of landscapes of great natural beauty. </p> <p> From the vantage point of the end of the twentieth century, it is  perhaps natural to regard the development of conservation stewardship as  a single discernible movement in American history, one which came of  age in the decades between 1850 and 1920, though it has continued to  expand and evolve in vital ways in the decades ever since.  To the  cultural historian probing the components of this movement, however, its  unity, and hence its inevitable coming of age in the nation's  consciousness, are far less clear.  On the contrary, what is most  striking is the eclectic nature of the historical trends and cultural  attitudes which coalesced in the development of conservation thought and  policy.  This collection of materials from the Library of Congress  reflects the conservation movement's complexity and heterogeneity. </p> <p> At the broadest level, the development of at least three distinct but  interlocking imperatives guided Americans' re-conception of their  relation to their natural environment in the 1850-1920 era, forming the  basic themes that find endless variation in the materials of this  collection: </p> <ul>  <li><strong>Scientific and technological concerns</strong>, including recognition of the human impact on the natural environment, and faith in the human capacity to manage that impact actively and wisely for human benefit;</li>  <li><strong>Philosophical, ethical, and spiritual values and symbolizations</strong>, including those which linked American \"nature\" to the construction of American national identity and character, and redefined the natural world as a moral and spiritual resource for urban and industrial man; </li>  <li><strong>Aesthetic considerations</strong>, including those which celebrated the perception and enjoyment of wildlife, wilderness, and natural beauty as legitimate and necessary recreational resources in American life. </li> </ul> <p>These fundamental preoccupations intersected with a cluster of deep  historical transformations--the triumph of large-scale  industrialization, urbanization, full-fledged commercial agriculture and  natural-resource extraction--all of which amounted to a fourth  formative pattern in the culture of the age: </p> <blockquote>  <p><strong>A profound revision in the man-land and man-nature relationships which had subsisted in America since the European settlement.</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>The development of conservation thought and policy may be traced from  these structural and ideological roots as they ramified throughout  American life to manifest themselves in a host of related phenomena,  including the following: </p> <blockquote>  <p>... a perceived crisis in American national identity and purpose,  expressed in part in the popularity of the \"Turner thesis\" (named for  the historian who developed it, Frederick Jackson Turner), which located  the source of American identity in the pioneer encounter with the  wilderness frontier, and deemed that frontier now \"closed\"</p>  <p> ... expressions of anti-urbanism and anti-modernism among intellectuals and the elite </p>  <p> ... the transformation of the old American pastoral/agrarian ideology  into the new suburban ideal, with its accoutrements of landscape  gardening, country clubs, summer camps, etc. </p>  <p> ... the burgeoning interest in camping and \"woodcraft\" as resources for  recreation and character development, especially for boys, and the  resulting formation of scouting organizations </p>  <p> ... the use of nature as an instrument of education and socialization,  as in the urban parks and playgrounds movement, and the movement for  \"nature study\" in schools </p>  <p> ... the development of landscape architecture as a profession </p>  <p> ... the intellectual mastery of the American landscape and its  resources, particularly in the West, attained by the body of  explorations and surveys in the later decades of the nineteenth century  that brought to a close white men's centuries-long calculation of the  continent </p>  <p> ... the use of photography to fix the image and identity of the  American landscape, especially in the \"wilderness\" west, in the  post-Civil War years </p>  <p> ... the practice of academic (but broadly popular) landscape painting  in the second half of the nineteenth century as a self-conscious  instrument marrying science, spirituality, and the celebration of the  American landscape as the source of the nation's moral identity </p>  <p> ... the development of scenic tourism by railway and (eventually) by  automobile, and the growing recognition of its economic importance </p>  <p> ... the growth of travel literature celebrating natural beauty and the pleasures of wild places </p>  <p> ... a growing body of reflective and analytical writings exploring man's relationship with nature </p>  <p> ... the proliferation of nature essays and nature-based fiction and  poetry in popular periodicals and books, with their implicit perception  of nature as a locus of moral authority </p>  <p> ... the sentimental celebration of nature as a theme in popular music and amateur painting </p>  <p> ... the growth of leisure time for the new urban and suburban middle  class, a function of the diminished temporal demands of  industrially-related as opposed to agricultural labor </p>  <p> ... the growth of hiking, mountaineering, angling, and game-hunting as  recreational activities, and the proliferation of amateur clubs to  sustain them </p>  <p> ... upper-class sportsmen's increasing concern about dwindling game  populations, and their readiness to exercise decisive leadership in many  aspects of the movement to conserve natural resources </p>  <p> ... the growth of \"birding\" as a popular hobby, and the proliferation  of amateur ornithological clubs and bird sanctuaries, whose sponsors  also moved quickly into positions of leadership in conservation advocacy </p>  <p> ... the consequent origins of what the historian Stephen R. Fox calls  the \"radical amateur\" tradition which led the development of American  conservationism into the 1960s </p>  <p> ... debate over the use, control, and distribution of the nation's remaining public lands and their resources </p>  <p> ... growing recognition of the disastrous consequences of deforestation, particularly in the eastern United States </p>  <p> ... increasing public anxiety over the perceived waste of the nation's natural endowment </p>  <p> ... ascendant confidence in the authority of science to guide human  knowledge and action, and in the power of technology to solve human  problems </p>  <p> ... the creative influence of scientists and engineers on the development of government policy concerning natural resources </p>  <p> ... the development of the Progressive Movement, with its characteristic faith in rational public management. </p> </blockquote> <p> These phenomena unfolded at a time in American history when the  now-familiar boundaries between amateur and professional science,  between science and religion, and between elite and popular culture were  in many ways far less fixed than they have since become.  Liberally  educated individuals could still speak with authority on scientific  matters, scientific investigation could still be construed as a  complement to religious faith, and instruments of cultural expression  commonly crossed class lines.  These factors, too, complexified the  historical ferment within which conservationism found its beginnings. </p> <p> From this milieu emerged the first great public accomplishments of the  American conservation movement, a constellation of projects in many  areas of the nation's life, devised on widely varying principles for  widely varying ends, that nevertheless succeeded in significantly  reorienting public policy and popular awareness toward the imperatives  of collective stewardship exercised on a scale unprecedented in the  history of the nation and, in some respects, the world.  Between 1850  and 1920, American conservationists invented the idea of the national  park and developed the national park system, establishing an  international model for the preservation of natural beauty and  wilderness; they instituted the practice of scientific forestry on a  broad scale in North America, adopted the principles of forestry as  government policy, established the national forest system, and founded  the Forest Service; they undertook large-scale technological management  of natural resources as a socially beneficent public objective, notably  through irrigation development; they passed state and Federal  legislation to protect certain classes of wildlife, and established a  system of national wildlife refuges; they participated in the beginnings  of systematic effort to control the impact of environmental pollution  on human health and welfare, especially in urban areas; they established  Arbor Day and Bird Day observances as a means of cultivating widespread  conservation awareness and individual conservation effort, especially  among school-children; and they supported President Theodore Roosevelt's  identification of conservation as a central object of national policy.   Even their divisions became definitive: the controversy over San  Francisco's proposal to dam Yosemite's Hetch Hetchy Valley galvanized  public consciousness of conservation issues, and crystallized the  tension between utilitarians and preservationists that has defined the  terms of conservation debate into the late twentieth century. </p> <p> For all its complexities and contradictions, for all its bargains with  greed and expedience and its failures of will or of vision (all of which  are, of course, easier to discern in the luxury of historical  hindsight), the early American conservation movement left a formidable  legacy.  At a time of revolutionary change and conflict in American  society, conservationists reasserted the moral obligation human beings  have to one another in their use of the natural world, and established  that obligation as a primary principle of the nation's public life.  At a  time when fewer and fewer of their fellow-citizens found their identity  in the soil, conservationists reconfigured the character of Americans'  moral relationship with nature.  Most fundamentally, perhaps, those who  shaped the early American conservation movement recovered for their  nation the abiding truth that what is human and what is natural are  parts of a single whole, and devised a repertoire of formal structures  and cultural strategies for giving that insight creative and enduring  form.  The materials in this collection are one measure of that  achievement. </p>"], "digitized": true, "extract_timestamp": "2020-11-14T06:30:04.837Z", "group": ["collections-portal"], "hassegments": false, "id": "https://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amrvhtml/conshome.html", "image_url": ["https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/evolution-of-the-conservation-movement/155_155.jpg#h=155&w=155", "https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/evolution-of-the-conservation-movement/500_500.jpg#h=500&w=500"], "index": 5, "items": "https://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amrvhtml/conshome.html", "location": ["united states"], "original_format": ["collection", "book", "photo, print, drawing", "manuscript/mixed material"], "other_title": [], "partof": ["the evolution of the conservation movement", "law library of congress", "manuscript division", "prints and photographs division", "digital collections", "geography and map division"], "shelf_id": "https://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amrvhtml/conshome.html", "subject": ["government, law & politics", "science & technology", "american history"], "subject_topic": ["science & technology", "american history", "government, law & politics"], "timestamp": "2020-11-14T07:45:50.665Z", "title": "The Evolution of the Conservation Movement", "url": "//memory.loc.gov/ammem/amrvhtml/conshome.html"}, {"_partof": "hannah arendt papers", "access_restricted": false, "aka": ["https://memory.loc.gov/ammem/arendthtml/arendthome.html", "https://www.loc.gov/collections/arendt/", "http://lccn.loc.gov/mm79011056", "https://www.loc.gov/item/mm79011056/", "https://www.loc.gov/resource/eadmss.ms001004/", "http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/collmss.ms000011", "http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/eadmss.ms001004.3", "https://www.loc.gov/resource/collmss.ms000011/", "https://www.loc.gov/resource/eadmss.ms001004.3/", "http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/eadmss.ms001004"], "campaigns": [], "contributor": ["arendt, hannah", "bl\u00fccher, heinrich"], "count": 25001, "dates": ["1898-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1899-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1900-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1901-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1902-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1903-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1904-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1905-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1906-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1907-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1908-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1909-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1910-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1911-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1912-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1913-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1914-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1915-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1916-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1917-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1918-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1919-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1920-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1921-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1922-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1923-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1924-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1925-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1926-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1927-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1928-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1929-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1930-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1931-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1932-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1933-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1934-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1935-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1936-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1937-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1938-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1939-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1940-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1941-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1942-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1943-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1944-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1945-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1946-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1947-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1948-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1949-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1950-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1951-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1952-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1953-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1954-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1955-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1956-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1957-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1958-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1959-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1960-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1961-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1962-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1963-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1964-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1965-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1966-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1967-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1968-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1969-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1971-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1972-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1973-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1974-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1975-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1976-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1977-01-01T00:00:00Z"], "description": ["<p>The papers of the author, educator, and political philosopher Hannah Arendt   (1906-1975) are one of the principal sources for the study of modern   intellectual life. Located in the Manuscript Division at the Library of   Congress, they constitute a large and diverse collection reflecting a complex   career. With over 25,000 items (about 75,000 digital images), the papers contain   correspondence, articles, lectures, speeches, book manuscripts, transcripts of   Adolf Eichmann's trial proceedings, notes, and printed matter pertaining to   Arendt's writings and academic career. The entire collection has been digitized   and is available to researchers in reading rooms at the Library of Congress, the   New School University in New York City, and the Hannah Arendt Center at the   University of Oldenburg, Germany.

The Hannah Arendt Papers (The Library of Congress Manuscript Division). </figcaption> </figure> <p>The Library of Congress received the Arendt Papers as a gift and bequest from   Hannah Arendt in various installments from 1965 to 2000. Small additions were   made by Klaus Loewald in 1981 and Roger Errera in 1994. </p> <p>The papers span the years 1898 to 1977, with the bulk of the material   beginning in 1948, three years before Arendt\u2019s naturalization as an American   citizen. The collection is organized in the following series: Family Papers,   Correspondence, Adolf Eichmann File, Subject File, Speeches and Writings File,   Clippings, Addition I, Addition II, and Addition III. Rich in manuscripts and   correspondence for Arendt's productive years as a writer and lecturer after   World War II, the papers are sparse before the mid-1940s because of Arendt's   forced departure from Nazi Germany in 1933 and her escape from occupied France   in 1941. Documentation for the first part of her life includes a few notebooks   and writings; several official and private records relating mainly to her   divorce, family history, and emigration; and a small group of personal   correspondence with her second husband, Heinrich Bl\u00fccher, some of whose letters   and unpublished writings can be found in the <a href=\"/static/collections/hannah-arendt-papers/articles-and-essays/family-papers/\">Family Papers</a> series. Much of   the material is in German and other European languages.</p> <p>Born Johanna Cohn Arendt, Arendt later used her married name, Bl\u00fccher, in   private life. Arendt studied with Karl Jaspers at Heidelberg University, but her   career was diverted from teaching and writing for more than a decade as a result   of Adolf Hitler's rise to power and the subsequent persecution of the Jews.   While in France and for several years in the United States, she worked as a   welfare agent in charge of aiding Jews and as a journalist for various Jewish   political and social organizations. Her papers document her support for the   creation of a Palestinian homeland for Jews until 1948, when she dissented from   certain policies of the new state of Israel.</p> <figure class=\"image-align-right\"> <img alt=\"\" src=\"/static/collections/hannah-arendt-papers/images/auden.jpg\" width=\"200\" />  <figcaption>W.H. Auden. Photographed by Arendt in her New York City   apartment, 1967. Courtesy of the Hannah Arendt Trust. </figcaption> </figure> <p>The largest portion of Arendt's papers consists of the <a href=\"/static/collections/hannah-arendt-papers/about-this-collection/correspondence.html\">Correspondence</a> series subdivided under the   headings of General Correspondence, Organizations, Publishers, and Universities   and Colleges. The material traces Arendt's intellectual, social, and   professional life from the late 1940s to her death. Though not a prolific letter   writer, Arendt corresponded with men and women of letters throughout Europe and   America, often for the purpose of giving a reference or arranging conference and   lecture dates, but just as frequently to exchange thoughts and ideas. Her   correspondents include obscure as well as renowned members of the literary and   academic community, many of whom sent her manuscripts in tribute to her   intellectual influence or to solicit her comments. Among the prominent   individuals whose names appear in the general correspondence are poets W. H.   Auden, Randall Jarrell, Robert Lowell, and Stephen Spender; historians Joachim   C. Fest and Carl J. Friedrich; and writers Alfred Kazin, Dwight Macdonald, Mary   McCarthy, and David Riesman. Readers should note that Arendt often typed replies   on the reverse side of the original letters that she received.</p> <p>Among correspondence pertaining to organizations, publishers, and   universities and colleges are occasional personal jottings from individuals who   wrote in an official capacity but were Arendt's friends and acquaintances as   well. Among their letters is correspondence with publishers and editors,   especially Robert B. Silvers of the <em>New York Review of Books</em>, William   Shawn of the <em>New Yorker</em>, and William Jovanovich of Harcourt Brace   Jovanovich, and with Saul Bellow and other faculty members at the University of   Chicago where Arendt was a professor and graduate student adviser on the   Committee on Social Thought.</p> <p>The <a href=\"/static/collections/hannah-arendt-papers/about-this-collection/eichmann.html\">Adolf Eichmann File</a> deals with what was perhaps Arendt's best-known and most controversial work, <em>Eichmann in Jerusalem</em>. Subtitled <em>A Report on the Banality of Evil</em>,   Arendt's conclusions about the nature and character of totalitarian rule in Nazi   Germany, and her interpretation of the Jewish response to the Holocaust,   prompted a strenuous and often emotional debate gathered in folders containing   book reviews, articles, and letters to the editors of the <em>New York Times</em> and the <em>New Yorker</em>. Also in the Eichmann files is material that Arendt   collected while covering the Nazi leader's trial in Jerusalem in 1961, including   incomplete but extensive copies of English and German transcripts of the trial's   proceedings, copies of the final ruling of the Israeli Supreme Court, and   several files of notes and miscellaneous background information. Drafts and   other related material for <em>Eichmann in Jerusalem</em> are located in the   Speeches and Writings series.</p> <p>The <a href=\"/static/collections/hannah-arendt-papers/about-this-collection/subject.html\">Subject File</a> chiefly treats Arendt's role as teacher and lecturer as reflected in the courses   she taught at the New School for Social Research, the University of California   at Berkeley, and the University of Chicago. Numerous lectures and seminar notes   by Arendt include copies of \"Kant's Political Philosophy\" delivered at both the   New School and the University of Chicago. Also included is material relating to   Arendt's students as well as contracts and royalties for her publications.</p> <p>The <a href=\"/static/collections/hannah-arendt-papers/about-this-collection/speeches.html\">Speeches and Writings   File</a> spans the years 1923-75. Arendt's doctoral dissertation, <em>Der   Liebesbegriff bei Augustin</em>, issued by Springer Verlag in 1929, is present in   the original published version and in a manuscript of an English translation, <em>Love and Saint Augustine</em>. Also in this series are various drafts of   lectures and chapters incorporated into Arendt's two-volume work <em>The Life of   the Mind</em>, published posthumously in 1978. Other book-length manuscripts   include the first and final drafts of <em>Between Past and Future</em>; the first   and final corrected copies of <em>Eichmann in Jerusalem</em>, with additional   drafts of the German translation; and <em>Men in Dark Times</em>. There are also   essays and lectures in the Speeches and Writings series in addition to the   lectures and seminar notes in the Subject File folders designated \"Courses\"   Research material arranged by topic is filed under \"Extracts and Notes\" in the   Speeches and Writings series. </p> <figure class=\"image-align-right\"> <img border=\"0\" alt=\"\" src=\"/static/collections/hannah-arendt-papers/images/mccarthy.jpg\" width=\"200\" />  <figcaption>Hannah Arendt and Mary McCarthy, ca. 1960s.

A small group of lectures is also contained in   this addition. <A href=\"/ammem/arendthtml/mharendtFolder08.html\">Addition II</A> includes correspondence from Arendt to Heinrich Bl\u00fccher and a notebook kept by   Arendt's mother recording Arendt's development as a child. <A href=\"/ammem/arendthtml/mharendtFolder09.html\">Addition III</A> contains   additional correspondence and notes by Arendt.</p> <p>In addition to the correspondents noted above, the Arendt Papers include   letters to and from Hanan J.

An English version of Kohler's work entitled <em>Within Four Walls: The   Correspondence between Hannah Arendt and Heinrich Bl\u00fccher, 1936-1968</em>,   translated by Peter Constantine (New York: Harcourt), was published in 2000.</p> <p>The papers of Hannah Arendt were initially organized and described in 1965   and 1967. A large group of the material received in 1977 was incorporated into   the collection in 1980. Items received in 1982 were processed as Addition I.   Material received between 1985 and 1997 was organized as Addition II in 1998,   and material comprising Addition III was received and organized in 2000. The   entire collection was reprocessed and the register was revised in 2000.

In view of the lengthy process that would have been   necessary to secure permission to release the entire collection online the   decision was made to concentrate on sections of the papers most useful for   researchers on Arendt and her work. With the advice of special consultant Jerome   Kohn, director of the Hannah Arendt Center, New School University, the project   staff identified the following series as the top priorities for seeking   copyright permissions: the Adolf Eichmann File, Subject File, Speeches and   Writings File, and Addition I, plus the \"General\" section of the Correspondence   File.</p> <p>The procedure to identify copyright holders of published and unpublished   materials in the collection written by people other than Hannah Arendt was a   complex one. For each document needing copyright permission, the author and   recipient, publisher or corporation, address, date, and biographical information   were recorded when available. This information was entered into a database to   facilitate research to identify and locate copyright holders in order to obtain   permissions. Resources online and in print were examined to locate the addresses   of approximately two thousand correspondents or their heirs in the United States   and numerous other countries.

Many new technologies and the new concept of scientific management in the work place had evolved during the first two decades of the century. In the 1920s these combined with an ability to produce and distribute goods on a mass scale amid widespread electrification of plants, factories, and households. These conditions led to a stabilization of the post-World War I economy that brought prosperity to many sectors.</p> <p>The materials in this digital collection highlight on the one hand business concerns, such as advertising, marketing, merchandising, and industrialization; and on the other popular notions about responsible consumerism, thriftiness, and efficiency in the home. The collection also focuses on President Coolidge's idea of government and on Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover's standardization initiatives. Lastly, the materials document groups that did not participate fully in the emergent consumer economy, notably farmers, both white and black, and immigrants. Far from exhaustive on any subject, the collection nonetheless suggests connections among some of the key technological developments, government structures, social organizations, and cultural assumptions that worked together to reinforce the mass-consumer economy.</p> <p>The themes of the collection were identified by the American Memory project team in collaboration with Library of Congress staff members and an advisory panel of historians. After reviewing the 1920s materials available at the Library, the project team selected materials for digitization from: the Manuscript Division, for personal and organizational papers; the General Collections, for books and periodicals; the Prints and Photographs Division, for photographs; and the Motion Picture, Broadcasting, and Recorded Sound Division, for films and recorded speeches.

It was  marked by massive European immigration and major population shifts  between regions of the  country, including migration from rural to urban centers that led to the  dramatic growth of cities.   During these fifty years, the nation's urban population increased from a  total of less than ten  million to more than fifty million people.  Blue-collar and white-collar  working people alike  benefited from an increase in personal income and leisure time.  Tourism  developed as an  American pastime, annual vacations became a national habit, and city  dwellers began taking half-holidays on Saturday.  Public amusements  appealed to growing numbers of people from many  walks of life.</p>   <p>Popular, live entertainment gained momentum in the late nineteenth century and reached  a peak in the first decade of the twentieth.  During the fifty-year period covered by this  collection, minstrel shows were eclipsed by the unprecedented success of variety theater and an  ever-increasing diversity of popular entertainment.  Burlesque developed into a full-fledged  theatrical form and modern amusement parks attracted huge crowds.  In 1909, for example,  Coney Island drew over 20 million visitors.  (After adjusting for population differentials, this is a  greater number than the combined attendance at Disneyland and Disney World in 1989.)        World's fairs, the three-ring circus, nightclubs, and the ballpark also flourished.  Theatrical road       shows traveled into the American hinterlands.  The cinema was born.</p> <p>The American Variety Stage Collection features materials that illustrate the diverse forms of variety theater that dominated the burgeoning entertainment world in the United States.  Variety stage, in this era, drew greater audiences than the \"legitimate\" theater which presented serious literary works.  Compared to the legitimate theater, which appealed, for the most part, to elite audiences, the variety stage was democratic and broad in approach.  The variety stage strove to attract all classes of people from every cultural background by offering varied programs and relatively low admission fees.</p> <p>To succeed at show business (as all forms of variety theater were called), entrepreneurs  provided public entertainment that transcended the specific tastes of a particular class or ethnicity.  It emphasized action and caricature.  Nevertheless, however broad or vulgar its humor,      it sought an aura of moral respectability.  Even burlesque shows attempted to do this by billing  themselves  as \"vaudeville\" and \"extravaganza\" and playing in theaters that had previously been  certified as \"respectable.\" </p> <figure  class='image-align-right'><a href=\"/item/var95-000382/\"><img      src=\"/static/collections/vaudeville-and-popular-entertainment/images/s1751701.jpg\"      width=\"150\" alt=\"\" /></a>     <figcaption><a href=\"/item/var95-000382/\">The Lone Hand Four Aces</a></figcaption> </figure> <p>Of all the types of variety entertainment, comedy is the best represented in this collection.   The English-language playscripts provide a wealth of information about what audiences found  amusing, or at least what writers thought the audience would find funny.  One can also learn  about such things as comedic techniques used, the structure of comic sketches, subjects used for  comedic purposes, and how material was customized for specific entertainers.  As well, the  collection can help shed light on the ways that vaudevillians tried to deal with contemporary  topics and concerns, especially those that now seem inappropriate (such as ethnic stereotypes,  gender and race prejudices, etc.), a topic that is especially ripe for study.</p> <p> Comedians often migrated, along with their jokes and skits, from minstrelsy to  vaudeville, from burlesque to recordings, to radio, and even to television.  Veteran performers  such as Bob Hope, George Burns, and Milton Berle have credited their early days in variety for  their subsequent success.</p> <p> The variety theater, in its most inclusive sense,  provided the American public with a  range of live entertainment:  comedy, musical presentations, novelty and specialty acts, stage magic, and stage spectacles.  American musical comedy was also in its formative stages during the fifty-year period covered by this collection.  Many early musical comedies of the period were glorified variety shows, more akin to European operettas than to what we now think of as musical comedy.

The scrapbook contains  approximately 130 items, including newspaper clippings, photographs, and a limited number  of manuscript materials, collected between 1855-72. A timeline, authored by Edward Wakeling,  former chairman of the Lewis Carroll Society, helps to place materials found in the scrapbook  in their proper context. </p> <p>Lewis Carroll is the pseudonym for the Reverend Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (1832-1898),  lecturer of mathematics at Oxford University, England.

His most notable feat was circumnavigating the earth from 1577-80, the first such voyage since Magellan's in 1522 and the only one up to that time captained by the same man from start to finish. Drake's expeditions to the Caribbean and the Pacific, undertaken during the circumnavigation and in subsequent voyages, revealed significant new geographical data about the New World and added greatly to Queen Elizabeth I's [1533-1603] treasury.</p>  <h2>The Collector</h2> <p>Assembled by Hans Peter Kraus and his wife Hanni in only twelve years, these materials reveal a great breadth and scope in the primary and secondary materials that concern Sir Francis Drake. Kraus was one of the foremost booksellers of the second half of the twentieth century. Born in Austria in 1907, he exhibited a precocious mind and a love of collecting from an early age\u2014which soon turned to a love of collecting books. He became a bookseller under the traditional antiquarian Austrian guild system\u2014first becoming an apprentice. In 1939, during the Nazi Occupation, Kraus and his family fled Austria for the United States. Within two weeks of his arrival in New York, Kraus met Hanni, his future wife and business partner. The couple established an antiquarian bookselling firm, H. P. Kraus, Inc., and amassed the stock and the connections needed for success. Their legendary firm opened in the early 1940s and did not close until 2003. The firm collected and sold many first rate editions.</p> <h2>The Collection</h2>  <p>In a 1968 James Ford Bell Lecture, Kraus explained how a chance comment about the enormous profit reaped by Sir Francis Drake and Queen Elizabeth from the around-the-world voyage piqued his interest and led him to study Drake's life. The more that Kraus learned, the more fascinated he became, and he resolved to put together a collection of contemporary materials related to Drake and his journeys. In 1980 Hans and Hanni Kraus generously donated their collection to the Rare Book and Special Collections Division of the Library of Congress. The combination of the Library's other rich collections from this period and the resources of the neighboring Folger Shakespeare Library make Washington a preeminent center for the study of the Elizabethan era.  The Kraus Collection consists of 60 items--16 manuscripts, 29 books, 8 maps and views, and 7 medals and portraits. The materials range in date from 1579 to 1765 and are written in English, Spanish, Latin, Italian, German, French, and Dutch.</p> <h3>Manuscripts</h3>  <p>Manuscripts range in date from 1579 to 1603. They are mostly correspondence between various governing officials and diplomats of the Spanish and English crowns regarding Drake's activities in Spanish America and are written in Spanish, English, Latin, and Italian. Many of the other documents concern legal or financial topics, including the record of Drake's sale of a 71-year lease of a house called the &quot;The Herbar.&quot;</p> <h3>Books</h3>  <p>Books range in date from 1581 to 1695 and are published in Spanish, English, Latin, German, French, and Dutch. Topics include general histories of exploration, trade, and navigation on the high seas including Drake's circumnavigation of the world. Other topics are of a more political nature and either extol Drake's accomplishments or decry his plunders in Spanish America. Still other accounts are biographies of the crowned heads Queen Elizabeth I and King Philip II [1527-1598].</p> <h3>Maps and views</h3>  <p>Maps and views range in date from 1570 to 1765 and were created by Spanish, Belgian, and English cartographers. Spanish America is depicted with drawings of fortresses and harbors as well as with maps of St. Augustine, South America, and the West Indies. There are also drawings depicting the Spanish Armada and the sea battles between the Spanish and the English. There is also a map of the world with an engraving of Drake and a map of Devonshire, England.</p> <h3>Medals and Portraits</h3>  <p>Medals and portraits range in date from 1583 to 1598 and are English, Spanish, and Dutch in origin. Two engraved medals commemorate the defeat of the Spanish Armada and two medals by Michael Mercator depict engravings of the world. There is also an engraving of Drake on paper, a series of portraits of sea explorers, and an oil portrait of Lord William Cecil Burghley, Queen Elizabeth I's secretary from 1558 to 1572.</p>"], "digitized": true, "extract_timestamp": "2020-12-18T06:31:03.468Z", "group": ["collections-portal"], "hassegments": false, "id": "http://international.loc.gov/intldl/drakehtml/rbdkhome.html", "image_url": ["https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/sir-francis-drake/155_155.jpg#h=155&w=155", "https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/sir-francis-drake/500_500.jpg#h=500&w=500"], "index": 2, "item": {"call_number": ["DA86.22.D7"], "contributors": ["Hans and Hanni Kraus Sir Francis Drake Collection (Library of Congress)", "Library of Congress."], "date": "2005", "format": ["text"], "language": ["eng"], "location": ["Great Britain", "Spain"], "notes": ["access level test"], "subjects": ["Drake, Francis,--approximately 1540-1596--Sources", "Explorers--Great Britain", "Explorers--Spain", "Great Britain--History, Naval--Tudors, 1485-1603", "Great Britain--History--Elizabeth, 1558-1603", "Hans and Hanni Kraus Sir Francis Drake Collection (Library of Congress)"], "summary": ["Sir Francis Drake, English explorer and naval strategist, circumnavigated the earth from 1577-1580.

Lomax and Alan Lomax's Library of Congress collecting work (Leadbelly, Woody Guthrie, Jelly Roll Morton), and Alan Lomax's less well-known field collections in Haiti in 1936 to 1937 and in the upper Midwest of the United States in 1938. There are hundreds of well-known and lesser-known treasures by other notable collectors including Herbert Halpert, Zora Neale Hurston, Henrietta Yurchenco, Vance Randolph, and Helen Creighton, among many others. The catalog also reflects exchange projects with institutions outside the United States, notably the Discoteca P\u00fablica Municipal de S\u00e3o Paulo Collection (1938-1943) of field recordings from Brazil; and field recordings collected in Oceania. The researcher may encounter duplicate or multiple cards for some of the non-English recordings in this catalog. The researcher should also be aware that for some non-English recordings from this period, no cards were made. We hope to expand the catalog in the future and add the bibliographic data for the sound recordings that are now represented only as \"Spanish\" or \"Foreign.\"</p> <p>The physical card catalog in the Archive is searchable only by title, performer, state (if U.S.), shelflist number (AFS number), or country/language (other than English). The online version of the catalog searches these areas, plus recording dates, recordist's names, and many others. Our plans are to continue to increase access to individually recorded items in our collections and to grow this database beyond just the cards represented in this online catalog to other collections in the Archive.</p> <p>Please note that this catalog represents only a portion of our recordings; in fact the majority of the Archive's recordings are not represented here. There is also information in the catalog that is incorrect and incomplete. We are continually working to make these corrections, and to add more material to the database.

In the United  States, however, between about 1850 and 1920, a heightened conservation  consciousness first emerged as a complex, broadly popular political and  cultural movement, based largely on a growing appreciation among  newly-urbanized Americans for the importance of nature as an economic,  aesthetic, and spiritual resource, together with a newly urgent  conviction that nature's resources were increasingly imperilled.  This  movement led to unprecedented public and private initiatives intended to  ensure the wise and scientific use of natural resources, and the  preservation of wildlife and of landscapes of great natural beauty. </p> <p> From the vantage point of the end of the twentieth century, it is  perhaps natural to regard the development of conservation stewardship as  a single discernible movement in American history, one which came of  age in the decades between 1850 and 1920, though it has continued to  expand and evolve in vital ways in the decades ever since.  To the  cultural historian probing the components of this movement, however, its  unity, and hence its inevitable coming of age in the nation's  consciousness, are far less clear.  On the contrary, what is most  striking is the eclectic nature of the historical trends and cultural  attitudes which coalesced in the development of conservation thought and  policy.  This collection of materials from the Library of Congress  reflects the conservation movement's complexity and heterogeneity. </p> <p> At the broadest level, the development of at least three distinct but  interlocking imperatives guided Americans' re-conception of their  relation to their natural environment in the 1850-1920 era, forming the  basic themes that find endless variation in the materials of this  collection: </p> <ul>  <li><strong>Scientific and technological concerns</strong>, including recognition of the human impact on the natural environment, and faith in the human capacity to manage that impact actively and wisely for human benefit;</li>  <li><strong>Philosophical, ethical, and spiritual values and symbolizations</strong>, including those which linked American \"nature\" to the construction of American national identity and character, and redefined the natural world as a moral and spiritual resource for urban and industrial man; </li>  <li><strong>Aesthetic considerations</strong>, including those which celebrated the perception and enjoyment of wildlife, wilderness, and natural beauty as legitimate and necessary recreational resources in American life. </li> </ul> <p>These fundamental preoccupations intersected with a cluster of deep  historical transformations--the triumph of large-scale  industrialization, urbanization, full-fledged commercial agriculture and  natural-resource extraction--all of which amounted to a fourth  formative pattern in the culture of the age: </p> <blockquote>  <p><strong>A profound revision in the man-land and man-nature relationships which had subsisted in America since the European settlement.</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>The development of conservation thought and policy may be traced from  these structural and ideological roots as they ramified throughout  American life to manifest themselves in a host of related phenomena,  including the following: </p> <blockquote>  <p>... a perceived crisis in American national identity and purpose,  expressed in part in the popularity of the \"Turner thesis\" (named for  the historian who developed it, Frederick Jackson Turner), which located  the source of American identity in the pioneer encounter with the  wilderness frontier, and deemed that frontier now \"closed\"</p>  <p> ... expressions of anti-urbanism and anti-modernism among intellectuals and the elite </p>  <p> ... the transformation of the old American pastoral/agrarian ideology  into the new suburban ideal, with its accoutrements of landscape  gardening, country clubs, summer camps, etc. </p>  <p> ... the burgeoning interest in camping and \"woodcraft\" as resources for  recreation and character development, especially for boys, and the  resulting formation of scouting organizations </p>  <p> ... the use of nature as an instrument of education and socialization,  as in the urban parks and playgrounds movement, and the movement for  \"nature study\" in schools </p>  <p> ... the development of landscape architecture as a profession </p>  <p> ... the intellectual mastery of the American landscape and its  resources, particularly in the West, attained by the body of  explorations and surveys in the later decades of the nineteenth century  that brought to a close white men's centuries-long calculation of the  continent </p>  <p> ... the use of photography to fix the image and identity of the  American landscape, especially in the \"wilderness\" west, in the  post-Civil War years </p>  <p> ... the practice of academic (but broadly popular) landscape painting  in the second half of the nineteenth century as a self-conscious  instrument marrying science, spirituality, and the celebration of the  American landscape as the source of the nation's moral identity </p>  <p> ... the development of scenic tourism by railway and (eventually) by  automobile, and the growing recognition of its economic importance </p>  <p> ... the growth of travel literature celebrating natural beauty and the pleasures of wild places </p>  <p> ... a growing body of reflective and analytical writings exploring man's relationship with nature </p>  <p> ... the proliferation of nature essays and nature-based fiction and  poetry in popular periodicals and books, with their implicit perception  of nature as a locus of moral authority </p>  <p> ... the sentimental celebration of nature as a theme in popular music and amateur painting </p>  <p> ... the growth of leisure time for the new urban and suburban middle  class, a function of the diminished temporal demands of  industrially-related as opposed to agricultural labor </p>  <p> ... the growth of hiking, mountaineering, angling, and game-hunting as  recreational activities, and the proliferation of amateur clubs to  sustain them </p>  <p> ... upper-class sportsmen's increasing concern about dwindling game  populations, and their readiness to exercise decisive leadership in many  aspects of the movement to conserve natural resources </p>  <p> ... the growth of \"birding\" as a popular hobby, and the proliferation  of amateur ornithological clubs and bird sanctuaries, whose sponsors  also moved quickly into positions of leadership in conservation advocacy </p>  <p> ... the consequent origins of what the historian Stephen R. Fox calls  the \"radical amateur\" tradition which led the development of American  conservationism into the 1960s </p>  <p> ... debate over the use, control, and distribution of the nation's remaining public lands and their resources </p>  <p> ... growing recognition of the disastrous consequences of deforestation, particularly in the eastern United States </p>  <p> ... increasing public anxiety over the perceived waste of the nation's natural endowment </p>  <p> ... ascendant confidence in the authority of science to guide human  knowledge and action, and in the power of technology to solve human  problems </p>  <p> ... the creative influence of scientists and engineers on the development of government policy concerning natural resources </p>  <p> ... the development of the Progressive Movement, with its characteristic faith in rational public management. </p> </blockquote> <p> These phenomena unfolded at a time in American history when the  now-familiar boundaries between amateur and professional science,  between science and religion, and between elite and popular culture were  in many ways far less fixed than they have since become.  Liberally  educated individuals could still speak with authority on scientific  matters, scientific investigation could still be construed as a  complement to religious faith, and instruments of cultural expression  commonly crossed class lines.  These factors, too, complexified the  historical ferment within which conservationism found its beginnings. </p> <p> From this milieu emerged the first great public accomplishments of the  American conservation movement, a constellation of projects in many  areas of the nation's life, devised on widely varying principles for  widely varying ends, that nevertheless succeeded in significantly  reorienting public policy and popular awareness toward the imperatives  of collective stewardship exercised on a scale unprecedented in the  history of the nation and, in some respects, the world.  Between 1850  and 1920, American conservationists invented the idea of the national  park and developed the national park system, establishing an  international model for the preservation of natural beauty and  wilderness; they instituted the practice of scientific forestry on a  broad scale in North America, adopted the principles of forestry as  government policy, established the national forest system, and founded  the Forest Service; they undertook large-scale technological management  of natural resources as a socially beneficent public objective, notably  through irrigation development; they passed state and Federal  legislation to protect certain classes of wildlife, and established a  system of national wildlife refuges; they participated in the beginnings  of systematic effort to control the impact of environmental pollution  on human health and welfare, especially in urban areas; they established  Arbor Day and Bird Day observances as a means of cultivating widespread  conservation awareness and individual conservation effort, especially  among school-children; and they supported President Theodore Roosevelt's  identification of conservation as a central object of national policy.   Even their divisions became definitive: the controversy over San  Francisco's proposal to dam Yosemite's Hetch Hetchy Valley galvanized  public consciousness of conservation issues, and crystallized the  tension between utilitarians and preservationists that has defined the  terms of conservation debate into the late twentieth century. </p> <p> For all its complexities and contradictions, for all its bargains with  greed and expedience and its failures of will or of vision (all of which  are, of course, easier to discern in the luxury of historical  hindsight), the early American conservation movement left a formidable  legacy.  At a time of revolutionary change and conflict in American  society, conservationists reasserted the moral obligation human beings  have to one another in their use of the natural world, and established  that obligation as a primary principle of the nation's public life.  At a  time when fewer and fewer of their fellow-citizens found their identity  in the soil, conservationists reconfigured the character of Americans'  moral relationship with nature.  Most fundamentally, perhaps, those who  shaped the early American conservation movement recovered for their  nation the abiding truth that what is human and what is natural are  parts of a single whole, and devised a repertoire of formal structures  and cultural strategies for giving that insight creative and enduring  form.  The materials in this collection are one measure of that  achievement. </p>"], "digitized": true, "extract_timestamp": "2020-12-18T06:32:30.409Z", "group": ["collections-portal"], "hassegments": false, "id": "http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amrvhtml/conshome.html", "image_url": ["https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/evolution-of-the-conservation-movement/155_155.jpg#h=155&w=155", "https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/evolution-of-the-conservation-movement/500_500.jpg#h=500&w=500"], "index": 5, "items": "http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amrvhtml/conshome.html", "location": ["united states"], "original_format": ["collection", "book", "photo, print, drawing", "manuscript/mixed material"], "other_title": [], "partof": ["the evolution of the conservation movement", "law library of congress", "manuscript division", "prints and photographs division", "digital collections", "geography and map division"], "shelf_id": "http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amrvhtml/conshome.html", "subject": ["government, law & politics", "science & technology", "american history"], "subject_topic": ["science & technology", "american history", "government, law & politics"], "timestamp": "2020-12-18T08:06:15.579Z", "title": "The Evolution of the Conservation Movement", "url": "//memory.loc.gov/ammem/amrvhtml/conshome.html"}, {"_partof": "prairie settlement: nebraska photographs and family letters, 1862-1912", "access_restricted": false, "aka": ["http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/award98/nbhihtml/pshome.html", "http://www.loc.gov/collections/nebraska/", "http://lccn.loc.gov/00528680", "http://www.loc.gov/item/00528680/", "http://www.loc.gov/resource/collgdc.gc000020/", "http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.gdc/collgdc.gc000020"], "campaigns": [], "contributor": ["butcher, solomon d.

Many new technologies and the new concept of scientific management in the work place had evolved during the first two decades of the century. In the 1920s these combined with an ability to produce and distribute goods on a mass scale amid widespread electrification of plants, factories, and households. These conditions led to a stabilization of the post-World War I economy that brought prosperity to many sectors.</p> <p>The materials in this digital collection highlight on the one hand business concerns, such as advertising, marketing, merchandising, and industrialization; and on the other popular notions about responsible consumerism, thriftiness, and efficiency in the home. The collection also focuses on President Coolidge's idea of government and on Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover's standardization initiatives. Lastly, the materials document groups that did not participate fully in the emergent consumer economy, notably farmers, both white and black, and immigrants. Far from exhaustive on any subject, the collection nonetheless suggests connections among some of the key technological developments, government structures, social organizations, and cultural assumptions that worked together to reinforce the mass-consumer economy.</p> <p>The themes of the collection were identified by the American Memory project team in collaboration with Library of Congress staff members and an advisory panel of historians. After reviewing the 1920s materials available at the Library, the project team selected materials for digitization from: the Manuscript Division, for personal and organizational papers; the General Collections, for books and periodicals; the Prints and Photographs Division, for photographs; and the Motion Picture, Broadcasting, and Recorded Sound Division, for films and recorded speeches.

It was  marked by massive European immigration and major population shifts  between regions of the  country, including migration from rural to urban centers that led to the  dramatic growth of cities.   During these fifty years, the nation's urban population increased from a  total of less than ten  million to more than fifty million people.  Blue-collar and white-collar  working people alike  benefited from an increase in personal income and leisure time.  Tourism  developed as an  American pastime, annual vacations became a national habit, and city  dwellers began taking half-holidays on Saturday.  Public amusements  appealed to growing numbers of people from many  walks of life.</p>   <p>Popular, live entertainment gained momentum in the late nineteenth century and reached  a peak in the first decade of the twentieth.  During the fifty-year period covered by this  collection, minstrel shows were eclipsed by the unprecedented success of variety theater and an  ever-increasing diversity of popular entertainment.  Burlesque developed into a full-fledged  theatrical form and modern amusement parks attracted huge crowds.  In 1909, for example,  Coney Island drew over 20 million visitors.  (After adjusting for population differentials, this is a  greater number than the combined attendance at Disneyland and Disney World in 1989.)        World's fairs, the three-ring circus, nightclubs, and the ballpark also flourished.  Theatrical road       shows traveled into the American hinterlands.  The cinema was born.</p> <p>The American Variety Stage Collection features materials that illustrate the diverse forms of variety theater that dominated the burgeoning entertainment world in the United States.  Variety stage, in this era, drew greater audiences than the \"legitimate\" theater which presented serious literary works.  Compared to the legitimate theater, which appealed, for the most part, to elite audiences, the variety stage was democratic and broad in approach.  The variety stage strove to attract all classes of people from every cultural background by offering varied programs and relatively low admission fees.</p> <p>To succeed at show business (as all forms of variety theater were called), entrepreneurs  provided public entertainment that transcended the specific tastes of a particular class or ethnicity.  It emphasized action and caricature.  Nevertheless, however broad or vulgar its humor,      it sought an aura of moral respectability.  Even burlesque shows attempted to do this by billing  themselves  as \"vaudeville\" and \"extravaganza\" and playing in theaters that had previously been  certified as \"respectable.\" </p> <figure  class='image-align-right'><a href=\"/item/var95-000382/\"><img      src=\"/static/collections/vaudeville-and-popular-entertainment/images/s1751701.jpg\"      width=\"150\" alt=\"\" /></a>     <figcaption><a href=\"/item/var95-000382/\">The Lone Hand Four Aces</a></figcaption> </figure> <p>Of all the types of variety entertainment, comedy is the best represented in this collection.   The English-language playscripts provide a wealth of information about what audiences found  amusing, or at least what writers thought the audience would find funny.  One can also learn  about such things as comedic techniques used, the structure of comic sketches, subjects used for  comedic purposes, and how material was customized for specific entertainers.  As well, the  collection can help shed light on the ways that vaudevillians tried to deal with contemporary  topics and concerns, especially those that now seem inappropriate (such as ethnic stereotypes,  gender and race prejudices, etc.), a topic that is especially ripe for study.</p> <p> Comedians often migrated, along with their jokes and skits, from minstrelsy to  vaudeville, from burlesque to recordings, to radio, and even to television.  Veteran performers  such as Bob Hope, George Burns, and Milton Berle have credited their early days in variety for  their subsequent success.</p> <p> The variety theater, in its most inclusive sense,  provided the American public with a  range of live entertainment:  comedy, musical presentations, novelty and specialty acts, stage magic, and stage spectacles.  American musical comedy was also in its formative stages during the fifty-year period covered by this collection.  Many early musical comedies of the period were glorified variety shows, more akin to European operettas than to what we now think of as musical comedy.

The scrapbook contains  approximately 130 items, including newspaper clippings, photographs, and a limited number  of manuscript materials, collected between 1855-72. A timeline, authored by Edward Wakeling,  former chairman of the Lewis Carroll Society, helps to place materials found in the scrapbook  in their proper context. </p> <p>Lewis Carroll is the pseudonym for the Reverend Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (1832-1898),  lecturer of mathematics at Oxford University, England.

His most notable feat was circumnavigating the earth from 1577-80, the first such voyage since Magellan's in 1522 and the only one up to that time captained by the same man from start to finish. Drake's expeditions to the Caribbean and the Pacific, undertaken during the circumnavigation and in subsequent voyages, revealed significant new geographical data about the New World and added greatly to Queen Elizabeth I's [1533-1603] treasury.</p>  <h2>The Collector</h2> <p>Assembled by Hans Peter Kraus and his wife Hanni in only twelve years, these materials reveal a great breadth and scope in the primary and secondary materials that concern Sir Francis Drake. Kraus was one of the foremost booksellers of the second half of the twentieth century. Born in Austria in 1907, he exhibited a precocious mind and a love of collecting from an early age\u2014which soon turned to a love of collecting books. He became a bookseller under the traditional antiquarian Austrian guild system\u2014first becoming an apprentice. In 1939, during the Nazi Occupation, Kraus and his family fled Austria for the United States. Within two weeks of his arrival in New York, Kraus met Hanni, his future wife and business partner. The couple established an antiquarian bookselling firm, H. P. Kraus, Inc., and amassed the stock and the connections needed for success. Their legendary firm opened in the early 1940s and did not close until 2003. The firm collected and sold many first rate editions.</p> <h2>The Collection</h2>  <p>In a 1968 James Ford Bell Lecture, Kraus explained how a chance comment about the enormous profit reaped by Sir Francis Drake and Queen Elizabeth from the around-the-world voyage piqued his interest and led him to study Drake's life. The more that Kraus learned, the more fascinated he became, and he resolved to put together a collection of contemporary materials related to Drake and his journeys. In 1980 Hans and Hanni Kraus generously donated their collection to the Rare Book and Special Collections Division of the Library of Congress. The combination of the Library's other rich collections from this period and the resources of the neighboring Folger Shakespeare Library make Washington a preeminent center for the study of the Elizabethan era.  The Kraus Collection consists of 60 items--16 manuscripts, 29 books, 8 maps and views, and 7 medals and portraits. The materials range in date from 1579 to 1765 and are written in English, Spanish, Latin, Italian, German, French, and Dutch.</p> <h3>Manuscripts</h3>  <p>Manuscripts range in date from 1579 to 1603. They are mostly correspondence between various governing officials and diplomats of the Spanish and English crowns regarding Drake's activities in Spanish America and are written in Spanish, English, Latin, and Italian. Many of the other documents concern legal or financial topics, including the record of Drake's sale of a 71-year lease of a house called the &quot;The Herbar.&quot;</p> <h3>Books</h3>  <p>Books range in date from 1581 to 1695 and are published in Spanish, English, Latin, German, French, and Dutch. Topics include general histories of exploration, trade, and navigation on the high seas including Drake's circumnavigation of the world. Other topics are of a more political nature and either extol Drake's accomplishments or decry his plunders in Spanish America. Still other accounts are biographies of the crowned heads Queen Elizabeth I and King Philip II [1527-1598].</p> <h3>Maps and views</h3>  <p>Maps and views range in date from 1570 to 1765 and were created by Spanish, Belgian, and English cartographers. Spanish America is depicted with drawings of fortresses and harbors as well as with maps of St. Augustine, South America, and the West Indies. There are also drawings depicting the Spanish Armada and the sea battles between the Spanish and the English. There is also a map of the world with an engraving of Drake and a map of Devonshire, England.</p> <h3>Medals and Portraits</h3>  <p>Medals and portraits range in date from 1583 to 1598 and are English, Spanish, and Dutch in origin. Two engraved medals commemorate the defeat of the Spanish Armada and two medals by Michael Mercator depict engravings of the world. There is also an engraving of Drake on paper, a series of portraits of sea explorers, and an oil portrait of Lord William Cecil Burghley, Queen Elizabeth I's secretary from 1558 to 1572.</p>"], "digitized": true, "extract_timestamp": "2020-12-12T06:30:33.336Z", "group": ["collections-portal"], "hassegments": false, "id": "http://international.loc.gov/intldl/drakehtml/rbdkhome.html", "image_url": ["https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/sir-francis-drake/155_155.jpg#h=155&w=155", "https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/sir-francis-drake/500_500.jpg#h=500&w=500"], "index": 2, "item": {"call_number": ["DA86.22.D7"], "contributors": ["Hans and Hanni Kraus Sir Francis Drake Collection (Library of Congress)", "Library of Congress."], "date": "2005", "format": ["text"], "language": ["eng"], "location": ["Great Britain", "Spain"], "notes": ["access level test"], "subjects": ["Drake, Francis,--approximately 1540-1596--Sources", "Explorers--Great Britain", "Explorers--Spain", "Great Britain--History, Naval--Tudors, 1485-1603", "Great Britain--History--Elizabeth, 1558-1603", "Hans and Hanni Kraus Sir Francis Drake Collection (Library of Congress)"], "summary": ["Sir Francis Drake, English explorer and naval strategist, circumnavigated the earth from 1577-1580.

The researcher may encounter duplicate or multiple cards for some of the non-English recordings in this catalog.

In the United  States, however, between about 1850 and 1920, a heightened conservation  consciousness first emerged as a complex, broadly popular political and  cultural movement, based largely on a growing appreciation among  newly-urbanized Americans for the importance of nature as an economic,  aesthetic, and spiritual resource, together with a newly urgent  conviction that nature's resources were increasingly imperilled.  This  movement led to unprecedented public and private initiatives intended to  ensure the wise and scientific use of natural resources, and the  preservation of wildlife and of landscapes of great natural beauty. </p> <p> From the vantage point of the end of the twentieth century, it is  perhaps natural to regard the development of conservation stewardship as  a single discernible movement in American history, one which came of  age in the decades between 1850 and 1920, though it has continued to  expand and evolve in vital ways in the decades ever since.  To the  cultural historian probing the components of this movement, however, its  unity, and hence its inevitable coming of age in the nation's  consciousness, are far less clear.  On the contrary, what is most  striking is the eclectic nature of the historical trends and cultural  attitudes which coalesced in the development of conservation thought and  policy.  This collection of materials from the Library of Congress  reflects the conservation movement's complexity and heterogeneity. </p> <p> At the broadest level, the development of at least three distinct but  interlocking imperatives guided Americans' re-conception of their  relation to their natural environment in the 1850-1920 era, forming the  basic themes that find endless variation in the materials of this  collection: </p> <ul>  <li><strong>Scientific and technological concerns</strong>, including recognition of the human impact on the natural environment, and faith in the human capacity to manage that impact actively and wisely for human benefit;</li>  <li><strong>Philosophical, ethical, and spiritual values and symbolizations</strong>, including those which linked American \"nature\" to the construction of American national identity and character, and redefined the natural world as a moral and spiritual resource for urban and industrial man; </li>  <li><strong>Aesthetic considerations</strong>, including those which celebrated the perception and enjoyment of wildlife, wilderness, and natural beauty as legitimate and necessary recreational resources in American life. </li> </ul> <p>These fundamental preoccupations intersected with a cluster of deep  historical transformations--the triumph of large-scale  industrialization, urbanization, full-fledged commercial agriculture and  natural-resource extraction--all of which amounted to a fourth  formative pattern in the culture of the age: </p> <blockquote>  <p><strong>A profound revision in the man-land and man-nature relationships which had subsisted in America since the European settlement.</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>The development of conservation thought and policy may be traced from  these structural and ideological roots as they ramified throughout  American life to manifest themselves in a host of related phenomena,  including the following: </p> <blockquote>  <p>... a perceived crisis in American national identity and purpose,  expressed in part in the popularity of the \"Turner thesis\" (named for  the historian who developed it, Frederick Jackson Turner), which located  the source of American identity in the pioneer encounter with the  wilderness frontier, and deemed that frontier now \"closed\"</p>  <p> ... expressions of anti-urbanism and anti-modernism among intellectuals and the elite </p>  <p> ... the transformation of the old American pastoral/agrarian ideology  into the new suburban ideal, with its accoutrements of landscape  gardening, country clubs, summer camps, etc. </p>  <p> ... the burgeoning interest in camping and \"woodcraft\" as resources for  recreation and character development, especially for boys, and the  resulting formation of scouting organizations </p>  <p> ... the use of nature as an instrument of education and socialization,  as in the urban parks and playgrounds movement, and the movement for  \"nature study\" in schools </p>  <p> ... the development of landscape architecture as a profession </p>  <p> ... the intellectual mastery of the American landscape and its  resources, particularly in the West, attained by the body of  explorations and surveys in the later decades of the nineteenth century  that brought to a close white men's centuries-long calculation of the  continent </p>  <p> ... the use of photography to fix the image and identity of the  American landscape, especially in the \"wilderness\" west, in the  post-Civil War years </p>  <p> ... the practice of academic (but broadly popular) landscape painting  in the second half of the nineteenth century as a self-conscious  instrument marrying science, spirituality, and the celebration of the  American landscape as the source of the nation's moral identity </p>  <p> ... the development of scenic tourism by railway and (eventually) by  automobile, and the growing recognition of its economic importance </p>  <p> ... the growth of travel literature celebrating natural beauty and the pleasures of wild places </p>  <p> ... a growing body of reflective and analytical writings exploring man's relationship with nature </p>  <p> ... the proliferation of nature essays and nature-based fiction and  poetry in popular periodicals and books, with their implicit perception  of nature as a locus of moral authority </p>  <p> ... the sentimental celebration of nature as a theme in popular music and amateur painting </p>  <p> ... the growth of leisure time for the new urban and suburban middle  class, a function of the diminished temporal demands of  industrially-related as opposed to agricultural labor </p>  <p> ... the growth of hiking, mountaineering, angling, and game-hunting as  recreational activities, and the proliferation of amateur clubs to  sustain them </p>  <p> ... upper-class sportsmen's increasing concern about dwindling game  populations, and their readiness to exercise decisive leadership in many  aspects of the movement to conserve natural resources </p>  <p> ... the growth of \"birding\" as a popular hobby, and the proliferation  of amateur ornithological clubs and bird sanctuaries, whose sponsors  also moved quickly into positions of leadership in conservation advocacy </p>  <p> ... the consequent origins of what the historian Stephen R. Fox calls  the \"radical amateur\" tradition which led the development of American  conservationism into the 1960s </p>  <p> ... debate over the use, control, and distribution of the nation's remaining public lands and their resources </p>  <p> ... growing recognition of the disastrous consequences of deforestation, particularly in the eastern United States </p>  <p> ... increasing public anxiety over the perceived waste of the nation's natural endowment </p>  <p> ... ascendant confidence in the authority of science to guide human  knowledge and action, and in the power of technology to solve human  problems </p>  <p> ... the creative influence of scientists and engineers on the development of government policy concerning natural resources </p>  <p> ... the development of the Progressive Movement, with its characteristic faith in rational public management. </p> </blockquote> <p> These phenomena unfolded at a time in American history when the  now-familiar boundaries between amateur and professional science,  between science and religion, and between elite and popular culture were  in many ways far less fixed than they have since become.  Liberally  educated individuals could still speak with authority on scientific  matters, scientific investigation could still be construed as a  complement to religious faith, and instruments of cultural expression  commonly crossed class lines.  These factors, too, complexified the  historical ferment within which conservationism found its beginnings. </p> <p> From this milieu emerged the first great public accomplishments of the  American conservation movement, a constellation of projects in many  areas of the nation's life, devised on widely varying principles for  widely varying ends, that nevertheless succeeded in significantly  reorienting public policy and popular awareness toward the imperatives  of collective stewardship exercised on a scale unprecedented in the  history of the nation and, in some respects, the world.  Between 1850  and 1920, American conservationists invented the idea of the national  park and developed the national park system, establishing an  international model for the preservation of natural beauty and  wilderness; they instituted the practice of scientific forestry on a  broad scale in North America, adopted the principles of forestry as  government policy, established the national forest system, and founded  the Forest Service; they undertook large-scale technological management  of natural resources as a socially beneficent public objective, notably  through irrigation development; they passed state and Federal  legislation to protect certain classes of wildlife, and established a  system of national wildlife refuges; they participated in the beginnings  of systematic effort to control the impact of environmental pollution  on human health and welfare, especially in urban areas; they established  Arbor Day and Bird Day observances as a means of cultivating widespread  conservation awareness and individual conservation effort, especially  among school-children; and they supported President Theodore Roosevelt's  identification of conservation as a central object of national policy.   Even their divisions became definitive: the controversy over San  Francisco's proposal to dam Yosemite's Hetch Hetchy Valley galvanized  public consciousness of conservation issues, and crystallized the  tension between utilitarians and preservationists that has defined the  terms of conservation debate into the late twentieth century. </p> <p> For all its complexities and contradictions, for all its bargains with  greed and expedience and its failures of will or of vision (all of which  are, of course, easier to discern in the luxury of historical  hindsight), the early American conservation movement left a formidable  legacy.  At a time of revolutionary change and conflict in American  society, conservationists reasserted the moral obligation human beings  have to one another in their use of the natural world, and established  that obligation as a primary principle of the nation's public life.  At a  time when fewer and fewer of their fellow-citizens found their identity  in the soil, conservationists reconfigured the character of Americans'  moral relationship with nature.  Most fundamentally, perhaps, those who  shaped the early American conservation movement recovered for their  nation the abiding truth that what is human and what is natural are  parts of a single whole, and devised a repertoire of formal structures  and cultural strategies for giving that insight creative and enduring  form.  The materials in this collection are one measure of that  achievement. </p>"], "digitized": true, "extract_timestamp": "2020-12-12T06:31:48.212Z", "group": ["collections-portal"], "hassegments": false, "id": "https://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amrvhtml/conshome.html", "image_url": ["https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/evolution-of-the-conservation-movement/155_155.jpg#h=155&w=155", "https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/evolution-of-the-conservation-movement/500_500.jpg#h=500&w=500"], "index": 5, "items": "https://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amrvhtml/conshome.html", "location": ["united states"], "original_format": ["collection", "book", "photo, print, drawing", "manuscript/mixed material"], "other_title": [], "partof": ["the evolution of the conservation movement", "law library of congress", "manuscript division", "prints and photographs division", "digital collections", "geography and map division"], "shelf_id": "https://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amrvhtml/conshome.html", "subject": ["government, law & politics", "science & technology", "american history"], "subject_topic": ["science & technology", "american history", "government, law & politics"], "timestamp": "2020-12-12T07:42:20.828Z", "title": "The Evolution of the Conservation Movement", "url": "//memory.loc.gov/ammem/amrvhtml/conshome.html"}, {"_partof": "prairie settlement: nebraska photographs and family letters, 1862-1912", "access_restricted": false, "aka": ["https://memory.loc.gov/ammem/award98/nbhihtml/pshome.html", "https://www.loc.gov/collections/nebraska/", "http://lccn.loc.gov/00528680", "https://www.loc.gov/item/00528680/", "https://www.loc.gov/resource/collgdc.gc000020/", "http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.gdc/collgdc.gc000020"], "campaigns": [], "contributor": ["butcher, solomon d.

Many new technologies and the new concept of scientific management in the work place had evolved during the first two decades of the century. In the 1920s these combined with an ability to produce and distribute goods on a mass scale amid widespread electrification of plants, factories, and households. These conditions led to a stabilization of the post-World War I economy that brought prosperity to many sectors.</p> <p>The materials in this digital collection highlight on the one hand business concerns, such as advertising, marketing, merchandising, and industrialization; and on the other popular notions about responsible consumerism, thriftiness, and efficiency in the home. The collection also focuses on President Coolidge's idea of government and on Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover's standardization initiatives. Lastly, the materials document groups that did not participate fully in the emergent consumer economy, notably farmers, both white and black, and immigrants. Far from exhaustive on any subject, the collection nonetheless suggests connections among some of the key technological developments, government structures, social organizations, and cultural assumptions that worked together to reinforce the mass-consumer economy.</p> <p>The themes of the collection were identified by the American Memory project team in collaboration with Library of Congress staff members and an advisory panel of historians. After reviewing the 1920s materials available at the Library, the project team selected materials for digitization from: the Manuscript Division, for personal and organizational papers; the General Collections, for books and periodicals; the Prints and Photographs Division, for photographs; and the Motion Picture, Broadcasting, and Recorded Sound Division, for films and recorded speeches.

It was  marked by massive European immigration and major population shifts  between regions of the  country, including migration from rural to urban centers that led to the  dramatic growth of cities.   During these fifty years, the nation's urban population increased from a  total of less than ten  million to more than fifty million people.  Blue-collar and white-collar  working people alike  benefited from an increase in personal income and leisure time.  Tourism  developed as an  American pastime, annual vacations became a national habit, and city  dwellers began taking half-holidays on Saturday.  Public amusements  appealed to growing numbers of people from many  walks of life.</p>   <p>Popular, live entertainment gained momentum in the late nineteenth century and reached  a peak in the first decade of the twentieth.  During the fifty-year period covered by this  collection, minstrel shows were eclipsed by the unprecedented success of variety theater and an  ever-increasing diversity of popular entertainment.  Burlesque developed into a full-fledged  theatrical form and modern amusement parks attracted huge crowds.  In 1909, for example,  Coney Island drew over 20 million visitors.  (After adjusting for population differentials, this is a  greater number than the combined attendance at Disneyland and Disney World in 1989.)        World's fairs, the three-ring circus, nightclubs, and the ballpark also flourished.  Theatrical road       shows traveled into the American hinterlands.  The cinema was born.</p> <p>The American Variety Stage Collection features materials that illustrate the diverse forms of variety theater that dominated the burgeoning entertainment world in the United States.  Variety stage, in this era, drew greater audiences than the \"legitimate\" theater which presented serious literary works.  Compared to the legitimate theater, which appealed, for the most part, to elite audiences, the variety stage was democratic and broad in approach.  The variety stage strove to attract all classes of people from every cultural background by offering varied programs and relatively low admission fees.</p> <p>To succeed at show business (as all forms of variety theater were called), entrepreneurs  provided public entertainment that transcended the specific tastes of a particular class or ethnicity.  It emphasized action and caricature.  Nevertheless, however broad or vulgar its humor,      it sought an aura of moral respectability.  Even burlesque shows attempted to do this by billing  themselves  as \"vaudeville\" and \"extravaganza\" and playing in theaters that had previously been  certified as \"respectable.\" </p> <figure  class='image-align-right'><a href=\"/item/var95-000382/\"><img      src=\"/static/collections/vaudeville-and-popular-entertainment/images/s1751701.jpg\"      width=\"150\" alt=\"\" /></a>     <figcaption><a href=\"/item/var95-000382/\">The Lone Hand Four Aces</a></figcaption> </figure> <p>Of all the types of variety entertainment, comedy is the best represented in this collection.   The English-language playscripts provide a wealth of information about what audiences found  amusing, or at least what writers thought the audience would find funny.  One can also learn  about such things as comedic techniques used, the structure of comic sketches, subjects used for  comedic purposes, and how material was customized for specific entertainers.  As well, the  collection can help shed light on the ways that vaudevillians tried to deal with contemporary  topics and concerns, especially those that now seem inappropriate (such as ethnic stereotypes,  gender and race prejudices, etc.), a topic that is especially ripe for study.</p> <p> Comedians often migrated, along with their jokes and skits, from minstrelsy to  vaudeville, from burlesque to recordings, to radio, and even to television.  Veteran performers  such as Bob Hope, George Burns, and Milton Berle have credited their early days in variety for  their subsequent success.</p> <p> The variety theater, in its most inclusive sense,  provided the American public with a  range of live entertainment:  comedy, musical presentations, novelty and specialty acts, stage magic, and stage spectacles.  American musical comedy was also in its formative stages during the fifty-year period covered by this collection.  Many early musical comedies of the period were glorified variety shows, more akin to European operettas than to what we now think of as musical comedy.

His most notable feat was circumnavigating the earth from 1577-80, the first such voyage since Magellan's in 1522 and the only one up to that time captained by the same man from start to finish. Drake's expeditions to the Caribbean and the Pacific, undertaken during the circumnavigation and in subsequent voyages, revealed significant new geographical data about the New World and added greatly to Queen Elizabeth I's [1533-1603] treasury.</p>  <h2>The Collector</h2> <p>Assembled by Hans Peter Kraus and his wife Hanni in only twelve years, these materials reveal a great breadth and scope in the primary and secondary materials that concern Sir Francis Drake. Kraus was one of the foremost booksellers of the second half of the twentieth century. Born in Austria in 1907, he exhibited a precocious mind and a love of collecting from an early age\u2014which soon turned to a love of collecting books. He became a bookseller under the traditional antiquarian Austrian guild system\u2014first becoming an apprentice. In 1939, during the Nazi Occupation, Kraus and his family fled Austria for the United States. Within two weeks of his arrival in New York, Kraus met Hanni, his future wife and business partner. The couple established an antiquarian bookselling firm, H. P. Kraus, Inc., and amassed the stock and the connections needed for success. Their legendary firm opened in the early 1940s and did not close until 2003. The firm collected and sold many first rate editions.</p> <h2>The Collection</h2>  <p>In a 1968 James Ford Bell Lecture, Kraus explained how a chance comment about the enormous profit reaped by Sir Francis Drake and Queen Elizabeth from the around-the-world voyage piqued his interest and led him to study Drake's life. The more that Kraus learned, the more fascinated he became, and he resolved to put together a collection of contemporary materials related to Drake and his journeys. In 1980 Hans and Hanni Kraus generously donated their collection to the Rare Book and Special Collections Division of the Library of Congress. The combination of the Library's other rich collections from this period and the resources of the neighboring Folger Shakespeare Library make Washington a preeminent center for the study of the Elizabethan era.  The Kraus Collection consists of 60 items--16 manuscripts, 29 books, 8 maps and views, and 7 medals and portraits. The materials range in date from 1579 to 1765 and are written in English, Spanish, Latin, Italian, German, French, and Dutch.</p> <h3>Manuscripts</h3>  <p>Manuscripts range in date from 1579 to 1603. They are mostly correspondence between various governing officials and diplomats of the Spanish and English crowns regarding Drake's activities in Spanish America and are written in Spanish, English, Latin, and Italian. Many of the other documents concern legal or financial topics, including the record of Drake's sale of a 71-year lease of a house called the &quot;The Herbar.&quot;</p> <h3>Books</h3>  <p>Books range in date from 1581 to 1695 and are published in Spanish, English, Latin, German, French, and Dutch. Topics include general histories of exploration, trade, and navigation on the high seas including Drake's circumnavigation of the world. Other topics are of a more political nature and either extol Drake's accomplishments or decry his plunders in Spanish America. Still other accounts are biographies of the crowned heads Queen Elizabeth I and King Philip II [1527-1598].</p> <h3>Maps and views</h3>  <p>Maps and views range in date from 1570 to 1765 and were created by Spanish, Belgian, and English cartographers. Spanish America is depicted with drawings of fortresses and harbors as well as with maps of St. Augustine, South America, and the West Indies. There are also drawings depicting the Spanish Armada and the sea battles between the Spanish and the English. There is also a map of the world with an engraving of Drake and a map of Devonshire, England.</p> <h3>Medals and Portraits</h3>  <p>Medals and portraits range in date from 1583 to 1598 and are English, Spanish, and Dutch in origin. Two engraved medals commemorate the defeat of the Spanish Armada and two medals by Michael Mercator depict engravings of the world. There is also an engraving of Drake on paper, a series of portraits of sea explorers, and an oil portrait of Lord William Cecil Burghley, Queen Elizabeth I's secretary from 1558 to 1572.</p>"], "digitized": true, "extract_timestamp": "2020-11-14T06:28:46.712Z", "group": ["collections-portal"], "hassegments": false, "id": "http://international.loc.gov/intldl/drakehtml/rbdkhome.html", "image_url": ["https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/sir-francis-drake/155_155.jpg#h=155&w=155", "https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/sir-francis-drake/500_500.jpg#h=500&w=500"], "index": 2, "item": {"call_number": ["DA86.22.D7"], "contributors": ["Hans and Hanni Kraus Sir Francis Drake Collection (Library of Congress)", "Library of Congress."], "date": "2005", "format": ["text"], "language": ["eng"], "location": ["Great Britain", "Spain"], "notes": ["access level test"], "subjects": ["Drake, Francis,--approximately 1540-1596--Sources", "Explorers--Great Britain", "Explorers--Spain", "Great Britain--History, Naval--Tudors, 1485-1603", "Great Britain--History--Elizabeth, 1558-1603", "Hans and Hanni Kraus Sir Francis Drake Collection (Library of Congress)"], "summary": ["Sir Francis Drake, English explorer and naval strategist, circumnavigated the earth from 1577-1580.

Lomax and Alan Lomax's Library of Congress collecting work (Leadbelly, Woody Guthrie, Jelly Roll Morton), and Alan Lomax's less well-known field collections in Haiti in 1936 to 1937 and in the upper Midwest of the United States in 1938. There are hundreds of well-known and lesser-known treasures by other notable collectors including Herbert Halpert, Zora Neale Hurston, Henrietta Yurchenco, Vance Randolph, and Helen Creighton, among many others. The catalog also reflects exchange projects with institutions outside the United States, notably the Discoteca P\u00fablica Municipal de S\u00e3o Paulo Collection (1938-1943) of field recordings from Brazil; and field recordings collected in Oceania. The researcher may encounter duplicate or multiple cards for some of the non-English recordings in this catalog. The researcher should also be aware that for some non-English recordings from this period, no cards were made. We hope to expand the catalog in the future and add the bibliographic data for the sound recordings that are now represented only as \"Spanish\" or \"Foreign.\"</p> <p>The physical card catalog in the Archive is searchable only by title, performer, state (if U.S.), shelflist number (AFS number), or country/language (other than English). The online version of the catalog searches these areas, plus recording dates, recordist's names, and many others. Our plans are to continue to increase access to individually recorded items in our collections and to grow this database beyond just the cards represented in this online catalog to other collections in the Archive.</p> <p>Please note that this catalog represents only a portion of our recordings; in fact the majority of the Archive's recordings are not represented here. There is also information in the catalog that is incorrect and incomplete. We are continually working to make these corrections, and to add more material to the database.

In the United  States, however, between about 1850 and 1920, a heightened conservation  consciousness first emerged as a complex, broadly popular political and  cultural movement, based largely on a growing appreciation among  newly-urbanized Americans for the importance of nature as an economic,  aesthetic, and spiritual resource, together with a newly urgent  conviction that nature's resources were increasingly imperilled.  This  movement led to unprecedented public and private initiatives intended to  ensure the wise and scientific use of natural resources, and the  preservation of wildlife and of landscapes of great natural beauty. </p> <p> From the vantage point of the end of the twentieth century, it is  perhaps natural to regard the development of conservation stewardship as  a single discernible movement in American history, one which came of  age in the decades between 1850 and 1920, though it has continued to  expand and evolve in vital ways in the decades ever since.  To the  cultural historian probing the components of this movement, however, its  unity, and hence its inevitable coming of age in the nation's  consciousness, are far less clear.  On the contrary, what is most  striking is the eclectic nature of the historical trends and cultural  attitudes which coalesced in the development of conservation thought and  policy.  This collection of materials from the Library of Congress  reflects the conservation movement's complexity and heterogeneity. </p> <p> At the broadest level, the development of at least three distinct but  interlocking imperatives guided Americans' re-conception of their  relation to their natural environment in the 1850-1920 era, forming the  basic themes that find endless variation in the materials of this  collection: </p> <ul>  <li><strong>Scientific and technological concerns</strong>, including recognition of the human impact on the natural environment, and faith in the human capacity to manage that impact actively and wisely for human benefit;</li>  <li><strong>Philosophical, ethical, and spiritual values and symbolizations</strong>, including those which linked American \"nature\" to the construction of American national identity and character, and redefined the natural world as a moral and spiritual resource for urban and industrial man; </li>  <li><strong>Aesthetic considerations</strong>, including those which celebrated the perception and enjoyment of wildlife, wilderness, and natural beauty as legitimate and necessary recreational resources in American life. </li> </ul> <p>These fundamental preoccupations intersected with a cluster of deep  historical transformations--the triumph of large-scale  industrialization, urbanization, full-fledged commercial agriculture and  natural-resource extraction--all of which amounted to a fourth  formative pattern in the culture of the age: </p> <blockquote>  <p><strong>A profound revision in the man-land and man-nature relationships which had subsisted in America since the European settlement.</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>The development of conservation thought and policy may be traced from  these structural and ideological roots as they ramified throughout  American life to manifest themselves in a host of related phenomena,  including the following: </p> <blockquote>  <p>... a perceived crisis in American national identity and purpose,  expressed in part in the popularity of the \"Turner thesis\" (named for  the historian who developed it, Frederick Jackson Turner), which located  the source of American identity in the pioneer encounter with the  wilderness frontier, and deemed that frontier now \"closed\"</p>  <p> ... expressions of anti-urbanism and anti-modernism among intellectuals and the elite </p>  <p> ... the transformation of the old American pastoral/agrarian ideology  into the new suburban ideal, with its accoutrements of landscape  gardening, country clubs, summer camps, etc. </p>  <p> ... the burgeoning interest in camping and \"woodcraft\" as resources for  recreation and character development, especially for boys, and the  resulting formation of scouting organizations </p>  <p> ... the use of nature as an instrument of education and socialization,  as in the urban parks and playgrounds movement, and the movement for  \"nature study\" in schools </p>  <p> ... the development of landscape architecture as a profession </p>  <p> ... the intellectual mastery of the American landscape and its  resources, particularly in the West, attained by the body of  explorations and surveys in the later decades of the nineteenth century  that brought to a close white men's centuries-long calculation of the  continent </p>  <p> ... the use of photography to fix the image and identity of the  American landscape, especially in the \"wilderness\" west, in the  post-Civil War years </p>  <p> ... the practice of academic (but broadly popular) landscape painting  in the second half of the nineteenth century as a self-conscious  instrument marrying science, spirituality, and the celebration of the  American landscape as the source of the nation's moral identity </p>  <p> ... the development of scenic tourism by railway and (eventually) by  automobile, and the growing recognition of its economic importance </p>  <p> ... the growth of travel literature celebrating natural beauty and the pleasures of wild places </p>  <p> ... a growing body of reflective and analytical writings exploring man's relationship with nature </p>  <p> ... the proliferation of nature essays and nature-based fiction and  poetry in popular periodicals and books, with their implicit perception  of nature as a locus of moral authority </p>  <p> ... the sentimental celebration of nature as a theme in popular music and amateur painting </p>  <p> ... the growth of leisure time for the new urban and suburban middle  class, a function of the diminished temporal demands of  industrially-related as opposed to agricultural labor </p>  <p> ... the growth of hiking, mountaineering, angling, and game-hunting as  recreational activities, and the proliferation of amateur clubs to  sustain them </p>  <p> ... upper-class sportsmen's increasing concern about dwindling game  populations, and their readiness to exercise decisive leadership in many  aspects of the movement to conserve natural resources </p>  <p> ... the growth of \"birding\" as a popular hobby, and the proliferation  of amateur ornithological clubs and bird sanctuaries, whose sponsors  also moved quickly into positions of leadership in conservation advocacy </p>  <p> ... the consequent origins of what the historian Stephen R. Fox calls  the \"radical amateur\" tradition which led the development of American  conservationism into the 1960s </p>  <p> ... debate over the use, control, and distribution of the nation's remaining public lands and their resources </p>  <p> ... growing recognition of the disastrous consequences of deforestation, particularly in the eastern United States </p>  <p> ... increasing public anxiety over the perceived waste of the nation's natural endowment </p>  <p> ... ascendant confidence in the authority of science to guide human  knowledge and action, and in the power of technology to solve human  problems </p>  <p> ... the creative influence of scientists and engineers on the development of government policy concerning natural resources </p>  <p> ... the development of the Progressive Movement, with its characteristic faith in rational public management. </p> </blockquote> <p> These phenomena unfolded at a time in American history when the  now-familiar boundaries between amateur and professional science,  between science and religion, and between elite and popular culture were  in many ways far less fixed than they have since become.  Liberally  educated individuals could still speak with authority on scientific  matters, scientific investigation could still be construed as a  complement to religious faith, and instruments of cultural expression  commonly crossed class lines.  These factors, too, complexified the  historical ferment within which conservationism found its beginnings. </p> <p> From this milieu emerged the first great public accomplishments of the  American conservation movement, a constellation of projects in many  areas of the nation's life, devised on widely varying principles for  widely varying ends, that nevertheless succeeded in significantly  reorienting public policy and popular awareness toward the imperatives  of collective stewardship exercised on a scale unprecedented in the  history of the nation and, in some respects, the world.  Between 1850  and 1920, American conservationists invented the idea of the national  park and developed the national park system, establishing an  international model for the preservation of natural beauty and  wilderness; they instituted the practice of scientific forestry on a  broad scale in North America, adopted the principles of forestry as  government policy, established the national forest system, and founded  the Forest Service; they undertook large-scale technological management  of natural resources as a socially beneficent public objective, notably  through irrigation development; they passed state and Federal  legislation to protect certain classes of wildlife, and established a  system of national wildlife refuges; they participated in the beginnings  of systematic effort to control the impact of environmental pollution  on human health and welfare, especially in urban areas; they established  Arbor Day and Bird Day observances as a means of cultivating widespread  conservation awareness and individual conservation effort, especially  among school-children; and they supported President Theodore Roosevelt's  identification of conservation as a central object of national policy.   Even their divisions became definitive: the controversy over San  Francisco's proposal to dam Yosemite's Hetch Hetchy Valley galvanized  public consciousness of conservation issues, and crystallized the  tension between utilitarians and preservationists that has defined the  terms of conservation debate into the late twentieth century. </p> <p> For all its complexities and contradictions, for all its bargains with  greed and expedience and its failures of will or of vision (all of which  are, of course, easier to discern in the luxury of historical  hindsight), the early American conservation movement left a formidable  legacy.  At a time of revolutionary change and conflict in American  society, conservationists reasserted the moral obligation human beings  have to one another in their use of the natural world, and established  that obligation as a primary principle of the nation's public life.  At a  time when fewer and fewer of their fellow-citizens found their identity  in the soil, conservationists reconfigured the character of Americans'  moral relationship with nature.  Most fundamentally, perhaps, those who  shaped the early American conservation movement recovered for their  nation the abiding truth that what is human and what is natural are  parts of a single whole, and devised a repertoire of formal structures  and cultural strategies for giving that insight creative and enduring  form.  The materials in this collection are one measure of that  achievement. </p>"], "digitized": true, "extract_timestamp": "2020-11-14T06:30:04.837Z", "group": ["collections-portal"], "hassegments": false, "id": "https://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amrvhtml/conshome.html", "image_url": ["https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/evolution-of-the-conservation-movement/155_155.jpg#h=155&w=155", "https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/evolution-of-the-conservation-movement/500_500.jpg#h=500&w=500"], "index": 5, "items": "https://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amrvhtml/conshome.html", "location": ["united states"], "original_format": ["collection", "book", "photo, print, drawing", "manuscript/mixed material"], "other_title": [], "partof": ["the evolution of the conservation movement", "law library of congress", "manuscript division", "prints and photographs division", "digital collections", "geography and map division"], "shelf_id": "https://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amrvhtml/conshome.html", "subject": ["government, law & politics", "science & technology", "american history"], "subject_topic": ["science & technology", "american history", "government, law & politics"], "timestamp": "2020-11-14T07:45:50.665Z", "title": "The Evolution of the Conservation Movement", "url": "//memory.loc.gov/ammem/amrvhtml/conshome.html"}, {"_partof": "hannah arendt papers", "access_restricted": false, "aka": ["https://memory.loc.gov/ammem/arendthtml/arendthome.html", "https://www.loc.gov/collections/arendt/", "http://lccn.loc.gov/mm79011056", "https://www.loc.gov/item/mm79011056/", "https://www.loc.gov/resource/eadmss.ms001004/", "http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/collmss.ms000011", "http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/eadmss.ms001004.3", "https://www.loc.gov/resource/collmss.ms000011/", "https://www.loc.gov/resource/eadmss.ms001004.3/", "http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.mss/eadmss.ms001004"], "campaigns": [], "contributor": ["arendt, hannah", "bl\u00fccher, heinrich"], "count": 25001, "dates": ["1898-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1899-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1900-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1901-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1902-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1903-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1904-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1905-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1906-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1907-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1908-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1909-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1910-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1911-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1912-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1913-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1914-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1915-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1916-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1917-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1918-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1919-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1920-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1921-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1922-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1923-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1924-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1925-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1926-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1927-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1928-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1929-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1930-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1931-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1932-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1933-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1934-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1935-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1936-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1937-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1938-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1939-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1940-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1941-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1942-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1943-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1944-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1945-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1946-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1947-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1948-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1949-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1950-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1951-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1952-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1953-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1954-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1955-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1956-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1957-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1958-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1959-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1960-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1961-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1962-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1963-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1964-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1965-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1966-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1967-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1968-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1969-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1971-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1972-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1973-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1974-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1975-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1976-01-01T00:00:00Z", "1977-01-01T00:00:00Z"], "description": ["<p>The papers of the author, educator, and political philosopher Hannah Arendt   (1906-1975) are one of the principal sources for the study of modern   intellectual life.

Much of   the material is in German and other European languages.</p> <p>Born Johanna Cohn Arendt, Arendt later used her married name, Bl\u00fccher, in   private life. Arendt studied with Karl Jaspers at Heidelberg University, but her   career was diverted from teaching and writing for more than a decade as a result   of Adolf Hitler's rise to power and the subsequent persecution of the Jews.   While in France and for several years in the United States, she worked as a   welfare agent in charge of aiding Jews and as a journalist for various Jewish   political and social organizations. Her papers document her support for the   creation of a Palestinian homeland for Jews until 1948, when she dissented from   certain policies of the new state of Israel.</p> <figure class=\"image-align-right\"> <img alt=\"\" src=\"/static/collections/hannah-arendt-papers/images/auden.jpg\" width=\"200\" />  <figcaption>W.H. Auden. Photographed by Arendt in her New York City   apartment, 1967. Courtesy of the Hannah Arendt Trust. </figcaption> </figure> <p>The largest portion of Arendt's papers consists of the <a href=\"/static/collections/hannah-arendt-papers/about-this-collection/correspondence.html\">Correspondence</a> series subdivided under the   headings of General Correspondence, Organizations, Publishers, and Universities   and Colleges. The material traces Arendt's intellectual, social, and   professional life from the late 1940s to her death. Though not a prolific letter   writer, Arendt corresponded with men and women of letters throughout Europe and   America, often for the purpose of giving a reference or arranging conference and   lecture dates, but just as frequently to exchange thoughts and ideas. Her   correspondents include obscure as well as renowned members of the literary and   academic community, many of whom sent her manuscripts in tribute to her   intellectual influence or to solicit her comments. Among the prominent   individuals whose names appear in the general correspondence are poets W. H.   Auden, Randall Jarrell, Robert Lowell, and Stephen Spender; historians Joachim   C. Fest and Carl J. Friedrich; and writers Alfred Kazin, Dwight Macdonald, Mary   McCarthy, and David Riesman. Readers should note that Arendt often typed replies   on the reverse side of the original letters that she received.</p> <p>Among correspondence pertaining to organizations, publishers, and   universities and colleges are occasional personal jottings from individuals who   wrote in an official capacity but were Arendt's friends and acquaintances as   well. Among their letters is correspondence with publishers and editors,   especially Robert B. Silvers of the <em>New York Review of Books</em>, William   Shawn of the <em>New Yorker</em>, and William Jovanovich of Harcourt Brace   Jovanovich, and with Saul Bellow and other faculty members at the University of   Chicago where Arendt was a professor and graduate student adviser on the   Committee on Social Thought.</p> <p>The <a href=\"/static/collections/hannah-arendt-papers/about-this-collection/eichmann.html\">Adolf Eichmann File</a> deals with what was perhaps Arendt's best-known and most controversial work, <em>Eichmann in Jerusalem</em>. Subtitled <em>A Report on the Banality of Evil</em>,   Arendt's conclusions about the nature and character of totalitarian rule in Nazi   Germany, and her interpretation of the Jewish response to the Holocaust,   prompted a strenuous and often emotional debate gathered in folders containing   book reviews, articles, and letters to the editors of the <em>New York Times</em> and the <em>New Yorker</em>. Also in the Eichmann files is material that Arendt   collected while covering the Nazi leader's trial in Jerusalem in 1961, including   incomplete but extensive copies of English and German transcripts of the trial's   proceedings, copies of the final ruling of the Israeli Supreme Court, and   several files of notes and miscellaneous background information. Drafts and   other related material for <em>Eichmann in Jerusalem</em> are located in the   Speeches and Writings series.</p> <p>The <a href=\"/static/collections/hannah-arendt-papers/about-this-collection/subject.html\">Subject File</a> chiefly treats Arendt's role as teacher and lecturer as reflected in the courses   she taught at the New School for Social Research, the University of California   at Berkeley, and the University of Chicago. Numerous lectures and seminar notes   by Arendt include copies of \"Kant's Political Philosophy\" delivered at both the   New School and the University of Chicago. Also included is material relating to   Arendt's students as well as contracts and royalties for her publications.</p> <p>The <a href=\"/static/collections/hannah-arendt-papers/about-this-collection/speeches.html\">Speeches and Writings   File</a> spans the years 1923-75. Arendt's doctoral dissertation, <em>Der   Liebesbegriff bei Augustin</em>, issued by Springer Verlag in 1929, is present in   the original published version and in a manuscript of an English translation, <em>Love and Saint Augustine</em>. Also in this series are various drafts of   lectures and chapters incorporated into Arendt's two-volume work <em>The Life of   the Mind</em>, published posthumously in 1978. Other book-length manuscripts   include the first and final drafts of <em>Between Past and Future</em>; the first   and final corrected copies of <em>Eichmann in Jerusalem</em>, with additional   drafts of the German translation; and <em>Men in Dark Times</em>. There are also   essays and lectures in the Speeches and Writings series in addition to the   lectures and seminar notes in the Subject File folders designated \"Courses\"   Research material arranged by topic is filed under \"Extracts and Notes\" in the   Speeches and Writings series. </p> <figure class=\"image-align-right\"> <img border=\"0\" alt=\"\" src=\"/static/collections/hannah-arendt-papers/images/mccarthy.jpg\" width=\"200\" />  <figcaption>Hannah Arendt and Mary McCarthy, ca. 1960s.

A small group of lectures is also contained in   this addition. <A href=\"/ammem/arendthtml/mharendtFolder08.html\">Addition II</A> includes correspondence from Arendt to Heinrich Bl\u00fccher and a notebook kept by   Arendt's mother recording Arendt's development as a child. <A href=\"/ammem/arendthtml/mharendtFolder09.html\">Addition III</A> contains   additional correspondence and notes by Arendt.</p> <p>In addition to the correspondents noted above, the Arendt Papers include   letters to and from Hanan J. Ayalti (pen name of Hanan Klenbort), Walter   Benjamin, Rosalie Littell Colie, Robert and Elke Gilbert, J. Glenn Gray,   Waldemar Gurian, Rolf Hochhuth, Hans Jonas, Lotte Kohler, Judah Leon Magnes,   Hans Joachim Morgenthau, Ruth H. Rosenau, Gershom Gerhard Scholem, Paul Tillich,   Eric Voegelin, Ernst Vollrath, Anne Weil, and Helen and Kurt Wolff.</p> <p>Lotte Kohler's <em>Hannah Arendt/Heinrich Bl\u00fccher: Briefe 1936-1968</em> (M\u00fcnchen: Piper, 1996) was consulted during the arrangement of the   correspondence between Arendt and Heinrich Bl\u00fccher in the Family Papers series.   An English version of Kohler's work entitled <em>Within Four Walls: The   Correspondence between Hannah Arendt and Heinrich Bl\u00fccher, 1936-1968</em>,   translated by Peter Constantine (New York: Harcourt), was published in 2000.</p> <p>The papers of Hannah Arendt were initially organized and described in 1965   and 1967. A large group of the material received in 1977 was incorporated into   the collection in 1980. Items received in 1982 were processed as Addition I.   Material received between 1985 and 1997 was organized as Addition II in 1998,   and material comprising Addition III was received and organized in 2000. The   entire collection was reprocessed and the register was revised in 2000. The   photographs have been transferred to the Library's Prints and Photographs   Division where they are identified as a part of these papers.

Mellon Foundation awarded the Library of   Congress a grant to support a two-year project to digitize the Hannah Arendt   Papers. The staff of the Manuscript Division at the Library administered the   project, with assistance from the National Digital Library Program (NDLP) and in   cooperation with the New School University in New York City. </p> <p>The digital version of the papers is being made available in two ways. The   collection is available in its entirety onsite at the Library of Congress and   two other research institutions. In addition, major portions of the collection   are available to the public on the Internet.</p> <h2 name=\"cdc\">Onsite Access to the Complete Digital Collection</h2> <p>The complete version of the digitized Arendt Papers (approximately 25,000   items; about 75,000 images) is available to researchers at three locations: the   reading room of the Manuscript Division at the Library of Congress, the New   School University\u2019s Hannah Arendt Center at the Fogelman Library, and the Hannah   Arendt Center at the University of Oldenburg, Germany.

In view of the lengthy process that would have been   necessary to secure permission to release the entire collection online the   decision was made to concentrate on sections of the papers most useful for   researchers on Arendt and her work. With the advice of special consultant Jerome   Kohn, director of the Hannah Arendt Center, New School University, the project   staff identified the following series as the top priorities for seeking   copyright permissions: the Adolf Eichmann File, Subject File, Speeches and   Writings File, and Addition I, plus the \"General\" section of the Correspondence   File.</p> <p>The procedure to identify copyright holders of published and unpublished   materials in the collection written by people other than Hannah Arendt was a   complex one. For each document needing copyright permission, the author and   recipient, publisher or corporation, address, date, and biographical information   were recorded when available. This information was entered into a database to   facilitate research to identify and locate copyright holders in order to obtain   permissions. Resources online and in print were examined to locate the addresses   of approximately two thousand correspondents or their heirs in the United States   and numerous other countries.

Many new technologies and the new concept of scientific management in the work place had evolved during the first two decades of the century. In the 1920s these combined with an ability to produce and distribute goods on a mass scale amid widespread electrification of plants, factories, and households. These conditions led to a stabilization of the post-World War I economy that brought prosperity to many sectors.</p> <p>The materials in this digital collection highlight on the one hand business concerns, such as advertising, marketing, merchandising, and industrialization; and on the other popular notions about responsible consumerism, thriftiness, and efficiency in the home. The collection also focuses on President Coolidge's idea of government and on Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover's standardization initiatives. Lastly, the materials document groups that did not participate fully in the emergent consumer economy, notably farmers, both white and black, and immigrants. Far from exhaustive on any subject, the collection nonetheless suggests connections among some of the key technological developments, government structures, social organizations, and cultural assumptions that worked together to reinforce the mass-consumer economy.</p> <p>The themes of the collection were identified by the American Memory project team in collaboration with Library of Congress staff members and an advisory panel of historians. After reviewing the 1920s materials available at the Library, the project team selected materials for digitization from: the Manuscript Division, for personal and organizational papers; the General Collections, for books and periodicals; the Prints and Photographs Division, for photographs; and the Motion Picture, Broadcasting, and Recorded Sound Division, for films and recorded speeches.

It was  marked by massive European immigration and major population shifts  between regions of the  country, including migration from rural to urban centers that led to the  dramatic growth of cities.   During these fifty years, the nation's urban population increased from a  total of less than ten  million to more than fifty million people.  Blue-collar and white-collar  working people alike  benefited from an increase in personal income and leisure time.  Tourism  developed as an  American pastime, annual vacations became a national habit, and city  dwellers began taking half-holidays on Saturday.  Public amusements  appealed to growing numbers of people from many  walks of life.</p>   <p>Popular, live entertainment gained momentum in the late nineteenth century and reached  a peak in the first decade of the twentieth.  During the fifty-year period covered by this  collection, minstrel shows were eclipsed by the unprecedented success of variety theater and an  ever-increasing diversity of popular entertainment.  Burlesque developed into a full-fledged  theatrical form and modern amusement parks attracted huge crowds.  In 1909, for example,  Coney Island drew over 20 million visitors.  (After adjusting for population differentials, this is a  greater number than the combined attendance at Disneyland and Disney World in 1989.)        World's fairs, the three-ring circus, nightclubs, and the ballpark also flourished.  Theatrical road       shows traveled into the American hinterlands.  The cinema was born.</p> <p>The American Variety Stage Collection features materials that illustrate the diverse forms of variety theater that dominated the burgeoning entertainment world in the United States.  Variety stage, in this era, drew greater audiences than the \"legitimate\" theater which presented serious literary works.  Compared to the legitimate theater, which appealed, for the most part, to elite audiences, the variety stage was democratic and broad in approach.  The variety stage strove to attract all classes of people from every cultural background by offering varied programs and relatively low admission fees.</p> <p>To succeed at show business (as all forms of variety theater were called), entrepreneurs  provided public entertainment that transcended the specific tastes of a particular class or ethnicity.  It emphasized action and caricature.  Nevertheless, however broad or vulgar its humor,      it sought an aura of moral respectability.  Even burlesque shows attempted to do this by billing  themselves  as \"vaudeville\" and \"extravaganza\" and playing in theaters that had previously been  certified as \"respectable.\" </p> <figure  class='image-align-right'><a href=\"/item/var95-000382/\"><img      src=\"/static/collections/vaudeville-and-popular-entertainment/images/s1751701.jpg\"      width=\"150\" alt=\"\" /></a>     <figcaption><a href=\"/item/var95-000382/\">The Lone Hand Four Aces</a></figcaption> </figure> <p>Of all the types of variety entertainment, comedy is the best represented in this collection.   The English-language playscripts provide a wealth of information about what audiences found  amusing, or at least what writers thought the audience would find funny.  One can also learn  about such things as comedic techniques used, the structure of comic sketches, subjects used for  comedic purposes, and how material was customized for specific entertainers.  As well, the  collection can help shed light on the ways that vaudevillians tried to deal with contemporary  topics and concerns, especially those that now seem inappropriate (such as ethnic stereotypes,  gender and race prejudices, etc.), a topic that is especially ripe for study.</p> <p> Comedians often migrated, along with their jokes and skits, from minstrelsy to  vaudeville, from burlesque to recordings, to radio, and even to television.  Veteran performers  such as Bob Hope, George Burns, and Milton Berle have credited their early days in variety for  their subsequent success.</p> <p> The variety theater, in its most inclusive sense,  provided the American public with a  range of live entertainment:  comedy, musical presentations, novelty and specialty acts, stage magic, and stage spectacles.  American musical comedy was also in its formative stages during the fifty-year period covered by this collection.  Many early musical comedies of the period were glorified variety shows, more akin to European operettas than to what we now think of as musical comedy.

The label of one De Valera recording states that with the sale of each record, a royalty of twenty-five cents would be paid to Dale Eireann, the revolutionary Irish Parliament.

It was  marked by massive European immigration and major population shifts  between regions of the  country, including migration from rural to urban centers that led to the  dramatic growth of cities.   During these fifty years, the nation's urban population increased from a  total of less than ten  million to more than fifty million people.  Blue-collar and white-collar  working people alike  benefited from an increase in personal income and leisure time.  Tourism  developed as an  American pastime, annual vacations became a national habit, and city  dwellers began taking half-holidays on Saturday.  Public amusements  appealed to growing numbers of people from many  walks of life.</p>   <p>Popular, live entertainment gained momentum in the late nineteenth century and reached  a peak in the first decade of the twentieth.  During the fifty-year period covered by this  collection, minstrel shows were eclipsed by the unprecedented success of variety theater and an  ever-increasing diversity of popular entertainment.  Burlesque developed into a full-fledged  theatrical form and modern amusement parks attracted huge crowds.  In 1909, for example,  Coney Island drew over 20 million visitors.  (After adjusting for population differentials, this is a  greater number than the combined attendance at Disneyland and Disney World in 1989.)        World's fairs, the three-ring circus, nightclubs, and the ballpark also flourished.  Theatrical road       shows traveled into the American hinterlands.  The cinema was born.</p> <p>The American Variety Stage Collection features materials that illustrate the diverse forms of variety theater that dominated the burgeoning entertainment world in the United States.  Variety stage, in this era, drew greater audiences than the \"legitimate\" theater which presented serious literary works.  Compared to the legitimate theater, which appealed, for the most part, to elite audiences, the variety stage was democratic and broad in approach.  The variety stage strove to attract all classes of people from every cultural background by offering varied programs and relatively low admission fees.</p> <p>To succeed at show business (as all forms of variety theater were called), entrepreneurs  provided public entertainment that transcended the specific tastes of a particular class or ethnicity.  It emphasized action and caricature.  Nevertheless, however broad or vulgar its humor,      it sought an aura of moral respectability.  Even burlesque shows attempted to do this by billing  themselves  as \"vaudeville\" and \"extravaganza\" and playing in theaters that had previously been  certified as \"respectable.\" </p> <figure  class='image-align-right'><a href=\"/item/var95-000382/\"><img      src=\"/static/collections/vaudeville-and-popular-entertainment/images/s1751701.jpg\"      width=\"150\" alt=\"\" /></a>     <figcaption><a href=\"/item/var95-000382/\">The Lone Hand Four Aces</a></figcaption> </figure> <p>Of all the types of variety entertainment, comedy is the best represented in this collection.   The English-language playscripts provide a wealth of information about what audiences found  amusing, or at least what writers thought the audience would find funny.  One can also learn  about such things as comedic techniques used, the structure of comic sketches, subjects used for  comedic purposes, and how material was customized for specific entertainers.  As well, the  collection can help shed light on the ways that vaudevillians tried to deal with contemporary  topics and concerns, especially those that now seem inappropriate (such as ethnic stereotypes,  gender and race prejudices, etc.), a topic that is especially ripe for study.</p> <p> Comedians often migrated, along with their jokes and skits, from minstrelsy to  vaudeville, from burlesque to recordings, to radio, and even to television.  Veteran performers  such as Bob Hope, George Burns, and Milton Berle have credited their early days in variety for  their subsequent success.</p> <p> The variety theater, in its most inclusive sense,  provided the American public with a  range of live entertainment:  comedy, musical presentations, novelty and specialty acts, stage magic, and stage spectacles.  American musical comedy was also in its formative stages during the fifty-year period covered by this collection.

The goal of the FCP (1977-1987) was to gather together thousands of such historical recordings held at the Library, in national and international repositories, at universities, and in private collections; produce catalog records; preserve the audio on reel-to-reel tape; and make the recordings available to communities of origin. In particular, the initiative focused on some 9,000 cylinder recordings of Native American cultural expressions, with the aim of sharing copies with those communities to further their work in linguistic maintenance and reclamation and ownership of cultural heritage. Between 1983 and 1988, thanks in part to a grant of $118,000 from the Ford Foundation, FCP project staff -- including scholars from the Library, the Smithsonian Institution, and public universities -- visited approximately 100 tribal communities and returned cassette copies of cylinder recordings (cassette being the most accessible format at the time)."], "digitized": true, "extract_timestamp": "2020-12-18T06:31:03.468Z", "group": ["collections-portal"], "hassegments": false, "id": "http://www.loc.gov/collections/ancestral-voices/about-this-collection/", "image_url": ["https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/ancestral-voices/155_155.jpg#h=155&w=155", "https://www.loc.gov/static/collections/ancestral-voices/500_500.jpg#h=500&w=500"], "index": 38, "items": "https://www.loc.gov/collections/ancestral-voices/", "original_format": ["collection", "sound recording"], "other_title": [], "partof": ["ancestral voices", "digital collections", "american folklife center"], "shelf_id": "~/collections/ancestral-voices/about-this-collection/", "subject": ["performing arts", "american history"], "subject_topic": ["performing arts", "american history"], "timestamp": "2020-12-18T08:06:15.579Z", "title": "Ancestral Voices", "url": "https://www.loc.gov/collections/ancestral-voices/about-this-collection/"}, {"access_restricted": false, "aka": ["http://www.loc.gov/collections/andre-kostelanetz-collection/about-this-collection/", "http://www.loc.gov/collections/kostelanetz/", "https://lccn.loc.gov/2006560769", "https://www.loc.gov/item/2006560769", "http://www.loc.gov/resource/eadmus.mu016011.3/", "http://www.loc.gov/item/2006560769/", "http://lccn.loc.gov/2006560769", "http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.music/eadmus.mu016011", "http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.music/eadmus.mu016011.3", "http://www.loc.gov/resource/eadmus.mu016011/", "https://www.loc.gov/collections/andre-kostelanetz-collection/about-this-collection/"], "campaigns": [], "contributor": ["kostelanetz, andre"], "count": 185, "date": "1922", "dates": ["1922-01-01T00:00:00Z"], "description": ["Andre Kostelanetz (1901-1980) was a Russian-born conductor, arranger, and pianist known for juxtaposing popular and classical repertoire in radio broadcasts during the 1930s and 1940s.

Kostelanetz's corrections, emendations, and notes to musical scores used in recording sessions and concert performances form another series in the collection. Corrections are handwritten on notebook paper and include both musical notation and lists of performance instructions. Most include instructions to Kostelanetz's assistant, Lou Robbins, for incorporating the corrections into the full score.  The Photographs series contains both professional photographs and snapshots that document Kostelanetz's career and personal life from approximately 1935 to 1980.
