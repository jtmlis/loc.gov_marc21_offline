These films range from the innovative silent film \u201cSuspense,\u201d which was co-directed by a woman in 1913, and Sidney Poitier\u2019s Oscar-winning performance in 1963\u2019s \u201cLilies of the Field\u201d to the 1978 mega-hit musical \u201cGrease,\u201d 1980\u2019s musical comedy \u201cThe Blues Brothers,\u201d and one of the biggest public vote getters, Christopher Nolan\u2019s 2008 Batman film \u201cThe Dark Knight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is not only a great honor for all of us who worked on \u2018The Dark Knight,\u2019 this is also a tribute to all of the amazing artists and writers who\u00a0have worked on the great mythology of Batman over the decades,\u201d said Nolan, director of \u201cThe Dark Knight.\u201d</p><p>Selected because of their cultural, historic or aesthetic importance to the nation\u2019s film heritage, the 2020 titles include blockbusters, musicals, silent films, documentaries and diverse stories transferred from books to screen. They bring the number of films selected for preservation in the registry to 800, a fraction of the 1.3 million films in the Library\u2019s collections.</p><p>This year\u2019s selections include a record number of films directed by women and filmmakers of color, including 10 directed by women and seven by people of color.</p><p>\u201cThe National Film Registry is an important record of American history, culture and creativity, captured through one of the great American artforms, our cinematic experience,\u201d Hayden said. \u201cWith the inclusion of diverse filmmakers, we are not trying to set records but rather to set the record straight by spotlighting the astonishing contributions women and people of color have made to American cinema, despite facing often-overwhelming hurdles.\u201d</p><p><strong>Turner Classic Movies</strong> (TCM) will host a television special <strong>Tuesday, Dec. 15</strong>, starting at 8 p.m. ET to screen a selection of motion pictures named to the registry this year.

For his 1963 portrayal of an itinerant worker who helps refugee nuns build a chapel in \u201cLilies of the Field,\u201d Sidney Poitier became the first African American to win the Oscar for best actor. Poitier said he has fond memories of the role.</p><p>\"\u2018Lilies of the Field\u2019\u00a0stirs up such great remembrances in our family, from the littlest\u00a0Poitiers watching a young and agile \u2018Papa\u2019 to the oldest \u2013 Papa Sidney himself!\u201d Poitier said in a statement with his family.</p><p>In \u201cThe Joy Luck Club\u201d from 1993, director Wayne Wang featured a formidable group of actresses telling the saga of two generations of Asian-American women, based on the bestselling book by Amy Tan.</p><p>\"I could have never imagined, after reading a few chapters of Amy's manuscript that eventually became \u2018The Joy Luck Club\u2019 book, that my dream of its adaptation would result in a movie that is still talked about decades later,\u201d said producer Janet Yang.\u00a0\u201cWhen people tell me \u2013 and so many from so many cultures have \u2013 that the movie helped heal a rift with their family, I am immensely gratified, and\u00a0it reminds me of the power of the moving image.\u201d</p><p>The 2020 film selections span nearly a century of filmmaking \u2013 from the silent era to the most recent film added to the registry, the PBS documentary \u201cFreedom Riders\u201d from 2010 where filmmaker Stanley Nelson captures the inspiring story of 1961 when 400 Black and white Americans risked their lives challenging Jim Crow segregation by traveling together on buses and trains through the Deep South.</p><p>The record-setting 10 films directed by women on the 2020 list include the 1913 silent film \u201cSuspense\u201d co-directed by Lois Weber; the 1918 silent film \u201cBread\u201d about a woman struggling to pull herself out of poverty, directed by Ida May Park; the 1929 film \u201cWith Car and Camera Around the World\u201d by Aloha Wanderwell; the 1950 film \u201cOutrage\u201d about the once verboten topic of sexual assault directed by Ida Lupino; one of the first feature films directed by a Black woman with Kathleen Collins\u2019 \u201cLosing Ground\u201d from 1982; groundbreaking director Julie Dash\u2019s student film \u201cIllusions\u201d confronting Hollywood racism from 1982; the 1994 film \u201cThe Devil Never Sleeps\u201d by Lourdes Portillo; \"Shrek,\" co-directed by Vicky Jenson in 2001; the 2006 film \u201cMauna Kea: Temple Under Siege\u201d co-directed by Joan Lander; and the atypical war film \u201cThe Hurt Locker\u201d about soldiers in Baghdad dismantling unexploded bombs, directed by Kathryn Bigelow in 2008.</p><p>\u201cMy desire in making \u2018The Hurt Locker\u2019 was to honor those in uniform serving in dangerous posts abroad, so I have been gratified by the resonance the film has had over the last 10 years,\u201d said Bigelow, who was the first woman to win an Oscar for best director for \u201cThe Hurt Locker.\u201d \u201cFor it to be selected by the National Film Registry is both humbling and thrilling.\u201d</p><p>Music is featured prominently in this year\u2019s selections, including the film adaptations of the Broadway musicals \u201cCabin in the Sky\u201d in 1943 and \u201cGrease\u201d in 1978, with unforgettable performances of John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John in the lead roles.</p><p>\u201cThe cast and crew of<span>\u00a0\u2018</span>Grease\u2019<span><em>\u00a0</em></span>have remained close for the past 40 years,\u201d said director Randal Kleiser. \u201cWe are all honored to be included in this year\u2019s national registry selection. Personally, I\u2019ve spent the last year composing all my script notations, storyboards and photographs.\u201d</p><p>This year\u2019s class also features the 1980 musical comedy \u201cThe Blues Brothers\u201d with its tribute to Chicago, soul and R&amp;B music \u2013 and cameos by legends like Cab Calloway, Ray Charles and Aretha Franklin.</p><p>\u201cHaving \u2018The Blues Brothers\u2019 chosen to be included in the National Film Registry is both a great honor and a delightful surprise. The film is the result of Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi\u2019s genuine passion for rhythm and blues and our mutual love for these great African American artists and the city of Chicago,\u201d said director John Landis, who has two additional films in the National Film Registry, \u201cAnimal House\u201d and Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cThriller.\u201d</p><p>Aykroyd added that \u201cJudy Belushi and I are exhilarated to see the performances of the African American musical stars in \u2018The Blues Brothers\u2019 film formally treasured for all time by the people of the United States. We feel grateful at being participants in making the movie and for this most worthwhile cultural preservation initiative.\"</p><p>In 2013, the Library of Congress released a report that conclusively determined that 70 percent of the nation\u2019s silent feature films have been lost forever and only 14 percent exist in their original 35 mm format.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Under the terms of the National Film Preservation Act, each year the Librarian of Congress names to the National Film Registry 25 motion pictures that are \u201cculturally, historically or aesthetically\u201d significant. The films must be at least 10 years old. More information about the National Film Registry can be found at <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/film\">loc.gov/film</a>.</p><p>The Librarian makes the annual registry selections after conferring with the distinguished members of the National Film Preservation Board (NFPB) and a cadre of Library specialists.

The comic bits include a renowned pie-fighting sequence where the principle of \u201creciprocal destruction\u201d escalates to epic proportions. \u201cBattle\u201d offers a stark illustration of the detective work (and luck) required to locate and preserve films from the silent era. Only excerpts from reel two of the film had survived for many years. Critic Leonard Maltin discovered a mostly complete nitrate copy of reel one at the Museum of Modern Art in the 1970s. Then in 2015, film collector and silent film accompanist Jon Mirsalis located a complete version of reel two as part of a film collection he purchased from the Estate of Gordon Berkow. The film still lacks brief scenes from reel one, but the film is now almost complete, comprising elements from MoMA, the Library of Congress, UCLA and other sources. It was restored by the UCLA Film and Television Archive in conjunction with Jeff Joseph/SabuCat. The nearly complete film was preserved from one reel of 35mm nitrate print, one reel of a 35mm acetate dupe negative and a 16mm acetate print.

Bann, Ray Faiola, David Gerstein<strong>.</strong>        \u00a0\u00a0</p><p><strong>The Blues Brothers (1980)<br /></strong>Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi, then both best known for their star-turns as part of the \u201cNot Ready for Prime-Time Players\u201d troupe on TV\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d took their recurring \u201cBlues Brothers\u201d SNL sketch to the big screen in this loving and madcap musical misadventures of Jake and Elwood Blues on a mission from God. An homage of sorts to various classic movie genres \u2014 from screwball comedy to road movie \u2014 \u201cThe Blues Brothers\u201d serves as a tribute to the lead duo\u2019s favorite city (Chicago) as well as a lovely paean to great soul and R&amp;B music.\u00a0 In musical cameos, such legends as Cab Calloway, Ray Charles, James Brown, Aretha Franklin and John Lee Hooker all ignite the screen.\u00a0</p><p><strong>Bread (1918)<br /></strong>Billed as a \u201csociological photodrama, \u201cBread\u201d tells the story of a na\u00efve young woman in a narrow-minded town who journeys to New York to become a star but faces disillusionment when she learns that sex is demanded as the price for fame. Ida May Park, director and scenarist of \u201cBread,\u201d was among more than a half-dozen prolific women directors working at the Universal Film Manufacturing Company during the period in which Los Angeles became the home of America\u2019s movie industry. Park directed 14 feature-length films between 1917 and 1920, and her career as a scenarist lasted until 1931. She reasoned that because the majority of movie fans were women, \u201cit follows that a member of the sex is best able to gauge their wants in the form of stories and plays.\u201d In an essay Park contributed to the book \u201cCareers for Women,\u201d she stated that women were advantaged as motion picture directors because of \u201cthe superiority of their emotional and imaginative faculties.\u201d In the two surviving reels of \u201cBread,\u201d one of only three films Park directed that are currently known to exist, she displays an accomplished ability to knowingly vivify her protagonist\u2019s plight as she fends off an attacker and places her frail hopes in a misshapen loaf of bread that has come to symbolize for her the good things in life.</p><p><strong>Buena Vista Social Club (1999)<br /></strong>\u201cThe best Wim Wenders documentary to date and an uncommonly self-effacing one, this 1999 concert movie about performance and lifestyle is comparable in some ways to \u2018Latcho Drom,\u2019 the great Gypsy documentary/musical. In 1996, musician Ry Cooder traveled to Havana to reunite some of the greatest stars of Cuban pop music from the Batista era (who were virtually forgotten after Castro came to power) with the aim of making a record, a highly successful venture that led to concerts in Amsterdam and New York. The players and their stories are as wonderful as the music, and the filmmaking is uncommonly sensitive and alert,\u201d wrote film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum.</p><p><strong>Cabin in the Sky (1943)<br /></strong>\u201cCabin\u201d tells the story of a man (Eddie \u201cRochester\u201d Anderson) trying to make it into heaven and who is sent back to earth for one last shot at redemption. Released the same year as Fox\u2019s \u201cStormy Weather,\u201d this film adaptation of the 1940 Broadway musical marked the directing debut of renowned director Vincente Minnelli (\u201cMeet Me in St. Louis,\u201d \u201cAn American in Paris,\u201d \u201cBad and the Beautiful,\u201d \u201cThe Band Wagon,\u201d and \u201cGigi\u201d). Minnelli\u2019s gift for ingeniously blending in dazzling musical numbers is on full display throughout. Lauded at the time for showcasing an all-Black cast in a major Hollywood film when many theaters in the U.S. were still segregated, the film also sadly demonstrates the limited film opportunities and acting compromises African Americans had to make during the Hollywood classic era. These notable concerns aside, \u201cCabin\u201d remains a glittering cultural record of outstanding African American artistic talent of the era (Ethel Waters, Lena Horne, Louis Armstrong, Rex Ingram, and Eddie \u201cRochester\u201d Anderson.)\u00a0</p><p><strong>A Clockwork Orange (1971)<br /></strong>Though based on the book by Anthony Burgess, it certainly took an eye and a mind like director Stanley Kubrick\u2019s to bring this film to life. Set in a not-so-distant future, that is equal parts dystopian and cartoonish, \u201cClockwork,\u201d now almost 50 years after its creation, remains as it always was: disturbing, controversial and startlingly unsettling. Malcolm MacDowell (in his most legendary role) stars as Alex DeLarge, the demented, de facto leader of a gang of boys-- sporting bowler hats, canes and codpieces--who wreak havoc all over what used to be England.\u00a0 But as evil as Alex is, when he\u2019s caught and subjected to a type of state-sanctioned crime aversion therapy, his \u201ctreatment\u201d turns out to be far more brutal than any of the crimes he\u2019s ever committed.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><strong>The Dark Knight (2008)<br /></strong>Bob Kane and Bill Finger\u2019s dark, enduring creation first flew onto the screen in a 1943 B-movie serial and would return to theaters several times in treatments both camp and action-oriented. But Christopher Nolan\u2019s evocative 2008 work reinvented the already vast Batman mythos thanks in no small part to its two intense, now legendary, lead performances:\u00a0 Christian Bale as the titular character and Heath Ledger, in a remarkable, Oscar-winning take on Bat super-villain \u201cThe Joker.\u201d\u00a0 Set in a dark, modern-day Gotham City, \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d is a visual feast of memorable set pieces, screenwriting flair, and characters and situations imbued with a soul and a conscience. \u201cPitched at the divide between art and industry, poetry and entertainment, \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d goes darker and deeper than any Hollywood movie of its comic-book kind,\u201d wrote Manohla Dargis of The New York Times. The theme of a world turned upside down by fear and dystopian chaos resonates eerily well in the pandemic havoc of 2020.</p><p><strong>The Devil Never Sleeps (1994)</strong><br />Early one Sunday morning in July, the filmmaker receives a phone call informing her that her beloved tio (uncle) Oscar Ruiz Almeida has been found dead of a gunshot wound to the head in Chihuahua, Mexico. His widow has declared his death a suicide. Most of his family, however, cry murder and point to a number of possible suspects: his business partner, his ranch-hand, the widow herself. In \u201cThe Devil Never Sleeps,\u201d Lourdes Portillo returns to the land of her birth to find out exactly who her uncle was and to investigate the circumstances of his death. She explores \"irrational\" as well as \"logical\" explanations, searching for clues on both sides of the border and in the history of her family. Old tales of betrayal, passion, lust and supernatural visitation emerge as we follow the filmmaker deep into the life of a community in the homeland of Pancho Villa. \u201cThe Devil Never Sleeps\u201d exposes the loves and hatreds of a Mexican family convulsed by the death of one of its members. The emotions that Portillo captures in her particular blend of traditional and experimental techniques bring out the nuances of Mexican social and family order. Poetic, tragic, humorous and mythic, this film crosses the borders of personal values, cultural mores and the discipline of filmmaking itself. It is a key film by a Latina filmmaker.</p><p><strong>Freedom Riders (2010)\u00a0\u00a0 <br /></strong>During 1961, more than 400 people from across the nation, black and white, women and men, old and young, challenged state-sanctioned segregation on buses and in bus terminals in the Deep South, segregation that continued after the Supreme Court had ruled the practice to be in violation of interstate commerce laws. Some 50 years later, \u201cFreedom Riders,\u201d a two-hour PBS American Experience documentary made by Stanley Nelson, charted their course in considerable depth as they faced savage retaliatory attacks and forced a reluctant federal government to back their cause. The riveting story is told without narration using archival film and stills and, most engagingly, through testimonies of the Freedom Riders themselves, journalists who followed their trail, federal, state, and local officials, white southerners, and chroniclers of the movement including Raymond Arsenault, whose book inspired the documentary. The film takes viewers through many complex twists and turns of the journey with extraordinary clarity and emotional force. The courage and conviction of the Freedom Riders, ordinary Americans willing to risk bodily harm and death to combat injustice nonviolently, will inspire later generations who watch Nelson\u2019s eloquent film. Nearly 50 full interviews conducted for the film are now available in the American Archive of Public Broadcasting at <a href=\"https://americanarchive.org/special_collections/freedom-riders-interviews\">https://americanarchive.org/special_collections/freedom-riders-interviews</a>.</p><p><strong>Grease (1978)<br /></strong>This tuneful, loving tribute to 1950s America \u2014 perhaps more romanticized than accurate \u2014 was first staged on Broadway in 1972. A huge hit, it would run for over 3,000 performances before closing in 1980. In 1978, the production was brought to the big screen with the addition of a few fresh songs and a cast including newly-minted superstar John Travolta and pop/country chanteuse Olivia Newton-John. Energetically directed by Randal Kleiser and loaded with beloved songs like \u201cYou\u2019re the One that I Want,\u201d \u201cWe Go Together,\u201d \u201cSummer Nights,\u201d \u201cHopelessly Devoted to You\u201d and \u201cGreased Lightin\u2019,\u201d \u201cGrease\u201d became the film of that year. It has never really left \u2014 becoming a staple for both local and high school productions, several Broadway revivals and even a live TV adaptation in 2016.\u00a0 \u201cGrease\u201d is still the word.</p><p><strong>The Ground (1993-2001)<br /></strong>The films of Robert Beavers are exceptional for their visual beauty, aural texture and depth of emotional expression. Beavers\u2019 films occupy a noble place within the history of avant-garde film, positioned at the intersection of structural and lyrical filmmaking traditions. They seem to embody the ideals of the Renaissance in their fascination with perception, psychology, literature, the natural world, architectural space, musical phrasing and aesthetic beauty. \u201cThe Ground<strong><em>\u201d</em></strong> uses seemingly simple components \u2014 the sunbaked landscape of a Greek island, the blue waters of the Aegean Sea and images of a man chiseling stone \u2014 to conjure the fundamental experience of holding something close to one\u2019s heart.</p><p><strong>The Hurt Locker (2008)<br /></strong>That great Hollywood staple, the \u201cwar movie,\u201d got a major reinvention in director Kathryn Bigelow\u2019s 2008 riveting and uncompromising look at contemporary warfare. Following the work of a Baghdad-based explosive ordnance disposal team, \u201cThe Hurt Locker\u201d strips away sentiment \u2014 and politics \u2014 to\u00a0 focus its camera on the rampant, second-by-second dangers and ethical dilemmas of modern-day soldiers. Jeremy Renner leads the skillful cast as a detonation expert for whom war seems a little too \u201cnormal.\u201d Along with winning that year\u2019s Best Picture Oscar, Bigelow was named as \u201cBest Director\u201d by the Academy, the first woman to receive that honor.</p><p><strong>Illusions (1982)<br /></strong>Born in New York City, Julie Dash is a filmmaker, music video and commercial director, author and website creator. Her film studies began in Harlem in 1969 but eventually led her to the American Film Institute and UCLA, where she made \u201c<em>The Diary of an African Nun\u201d</em><em>\u00a0</em>(1977), based on a short story by Alice Walker, which won a student award from the Directors Guild of America. Dash\u2019s critically acclaimed short film \u201c<em>Illusions\u201d</em> (1982) later won the Jury Prize for Best Film of the Decade awarded by the Black Filmmakers Foundation. Created for her MFA thesis at UCLA, \u201cIllusions, is set in World War II-era Hollywood and explores the nature of Hollywood racial politics, fantasy and the illusion of racial identity.</p><p><strong>The Joy Luck Club (1993)        \u00a0 <br /></strong>Director Wayne Wang's adaptation of Amy Tan's novel tells a story of relationships between Chinese-American women and their Chinese immigrant mothers.\u00a0 The four mothers meet weekly to play Mahjong, tell stories and reminisce. The richly layered plot features key themes including the often complicated relationships between mothers and daughters, assimilation into a far different culture, wistfulness for aspects of former lifestyles, the intersections between past and present, and the strong bond of family ties between two generations who grew up in vastly different circumstances.\u00a0 Wang\u2019s film \u201cChan Is Missing\u201d was selected to the National Film Registry in 1995.</p><p><strong>Kid Auto Races at Venice (1914)</strong><br />A milestone in film history, \u201cKid Auto Races at Venice\u201d features the debut of Charlie Chaplin\u2019s little tramp character as he continually disrupts a cameraman trying to film a soapbox derby car race. A contemporary review in The Cinema noted, \"Kid Auto Races struck us as about the funniest film we have ever seen. When we subsequently saw Chaplin in more ambitious efforts, our opinion that the Keystone Company had made the capture of their career was strengthened. Chaplin is a born screen comedian; he does things we have never seen done on the screen before.\u201d</p><p><strong>Lilies of the Field (1963) <br /></strong>From 1950 to 1980, Sidney Poitier ranked among the top American film stars (\u201cNo Way Out,\u201d \u201cBlackboard Jungle,\u201d \u201cEdge of the City,\u201d \u201cThe Defiant Ones,\u201d \u201cRaisin in the Sun,\u201d \u201cParis Blues,\u201d \u201cIn the Heat of the Night,\u201d \u201cGuess Who\u2019s Coming to Dinner\u201d). In \u201cLilies,\u201d Poitier has another of his classic roles where he plays an itinerant worker who helps refugee East European nuns build a chapel in Arizona. The nuns cannot pay him for the work and implore him to do so by citing various Biblical verses (Sermon on the Mount). Poitier, for his part, is moved by their plight but also wants to demonstrate his skills as an architect and builder. The film serves as a parable highlighting mutual respect via common purpose, the austere Arizona desert landscape, the impoverished nuns, and a man they believe God sent to help them. For his portrayal, Poitier became the first African American to win the Oscar for best actor.</p><p><strong>Losing Ground (1982)     <br /></strong>One of the first feature films directed by an African American woman, Kathleen Collins\u2019 \u201cLosing Ground\u201d tells the story of a marriage between two remarkable people, both at a crossroads in their lives.\u00a0\u201cLosing Ground\u201d centers on the experiences of Sara (Seret Scott), an African American philosophy professor whose artist husband Victor (Bill Gunn) rents a country house for a month to celebrate a recent museum sale. The couple\u2019s summer idyll becomes complicated as Sara struggles to research the philosophical and religious meaning of ecstatic experience ...and to discover it for herself.</p><p><strong>The Man With the Golden Arm (1955) <br /></strong>The subject of drug addiction has been addressed in Hollywood films many times before, dating all the way back to the silent era (Kevin Brownlow\u2019s seminal \u201cBehind the Mask of Innocence\u201d chronicles these amazing early productions). But few dared to be as honest, blunt or graphic as this Otto Preminger treatment, which featured Frank Sinatra and Kim Novak. Sinatra stars as the heroin-addicted hero who, having gotten clean while in prison, now struggles to remain \u201cstraight\u201d after release. Oscar-nominated for his work in the film, Sinatra is a raw nerve in his unvarnished portrayal of a \u201cjunkie,\u201d most memorably in his brutal withdrawal scenes. Along with its still topical subject and powerful storytelling, the film is further enhanced by its eye-popping Saul Bass opening credits sequence and Elmer Bernstein\u2019s remarkable jazz score. Critic Dave Kehr has noted that \u201cOtto Preminger's 1955 adaptation of Nelson Algren's novel is something of a crossroads movie, suspended between the swirling expressionism of Preminger's early career and the balanced realism that would later become his forte.\u201d\u00a0 The film was preserved by the Academy Film Archive in 2005 with funding from the Film Foundation and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association.</p><p><strong>Mauna Kea: Temple Under Siege (2006)        <br /></strong>Produced and directed by Puhipau and Joan Lander of N\u0101 Maka o ka \u02bb\u0100ina, this documentary about the dormant volcano on the Big Island of Hawai\u2019i examines the development vs. ecological preservation battle between scientists who use the mountain summit as an astronomical observatory and Hawaiians who want the mountain preserved as a cultural landscape sacred to the Hawaiian people.</p><p><strong>Outrage (1950)<br /></strong>For a few years beginning in the late 1940s, Ida Lupino, Hollywood\u2019s only woman director of the period, made a series of distinctive films that spoke to the public\u2019s desire, she stated, \u201cto see something that fits in with their own concepts of the way people actually live in the world and the problems they must meet and overcome.\u201d In \u201cOutrage,\u201d an unblinking examination of the traumatic effects of rape on a vulnerable young woman, Lupino, an actress of consummate grace and power, masterfully employed sound and silence, light and shadow, depth of field and cutting, camera movement and careful framing to cinematically capture the psychological impact of her character\u2019s shattered world. Inspired by a question that Italian neo-realist director Roberto Rossellini posed to her at a party \u2013 \u201cWhen are you going to make pictures about ordinary people, in ordinary situations\u201d \u2013 Lupino, along with her husband Collier Young, associate producer Malvin Wald, and cinematographer Archie Stout created a series of low-budget impactful films with newfound talent, like Mala Powers, star of \u201cOutrage.\u201d Lupino\u2019s films, Martin Scorsese has observed, \u201caddressed the wounded soul and traced the slow, painful process of women trying to wrestle with despair and reclaim their lives.\u201d</p><p><strong>Shrek (2001)                                            \u00a0\u00a0 <br /></strong>Even by DreamWorks standards, the charm and magic of \u201cShrek\u201d seemed extraordinary upon its initial release almost 20 years ago \u2014 and its power has yet to diminish in the intervening years. With this story of a green-skinned, solitude-loving ogre, Shrek, who embarks on a noble quest, alongside his new friend, a lovable donkey, the film manages to be both a send-up of fairy tale tropes and an affectionate tribute to them. Entertaining and emotionally impactful at levels to be appreciated by both children and their adults, \u201cShrek\u201d was a mega-hit upon its release and has been followed by three equally enchanting sequels, a TV holiday special and a Broadway adaption. Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy and Cameron Diaz lead the strong voice cast.</p><p><strong>Suspense (1913)\u00a0\u00a0 <br /></strong>During the 1910s, women directors played a prominent role in the development of film as an art form. Chief among them was Lois Weber who was recognized alongside directors such as D.W. Griffith and Cecil B. DeMille. Weber\u2019s films often touched on controversial social issues such as poverty and contraception.\u00a0 In a 1913 Photoplay interview, Weber spoke of her desire to create films \u201cthat will have an influence for good on the public mind.\u201d In this 1913 short, \u201cA wife and her baby are alone in an isolated house when a tramp breaks in. As the wife tries to keep the invader at bay, her husband happens to telephone and learn what\u2019s happening. He scrambles to return home. He steals an idle car, and its owner, accompanied by police, race after him. We cut rapidly between the besieged mother and the husband\u2019s frantic drive, as he is in turn pursued. Just as the tramp is about to attack the wife, the husband bursts in, followed by the police. The family is saved. This is the plot of \u201cSuspense,\u201d co-directed by Lois Weber and Phillips Smalley. If the plot sounds familiar, it\u2019s probably because you know that one of D.W. Griffith\u2019s most famous films, \u201cThe Lonely Villa\u201d (1909) tells the same basic tale. So Weber and Smalley are reviving an old idea. Their task is to make it fresh. How they do so has been studied in depth by Charlie Keil in his book \u201c<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Early-American-Cinema-Transition-Supervising/dp/029917364X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1217997344&amp;sr=8-1\">Early American Cinema in Transition: Story, Style, and Filmmaking, 1907-1913</a>,\u201d wrote film historian David Bordwell.</p><p><strong>Sweet Sweetback\u2019s Baadasssss Song (1971)<br /></strong>With \u201cSweet Sweetback,\u201d director Melvin Van Peebles touched off a wave of imitative Black features, few of which matched his startling originality and fierce attacks. The story of a male \u201cperformer\u201d at a ghetto bordello and his run from the law, the film shrewdly mixes commercial ingredients and ideological intent. \u201cIt would be difficult to underestimate Melvin Van Peebles's achievement in producing, directing, writing, scoring and starring in this film, not to mention financing it with the salary he had earned while directing \u201cWatermelon Man\u201d (1970). Not since Oscar Micheaux had an African American filmmaker taken such complete control of the creative process, turning out a work so deeply connected to his own personal and cultural reality that he was not surprised when the white critical establishment professed bewilderment upon its release in 1971. Filled with enough sex, rage and violence to earn it an X rating, the success of \u201cSweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song\u201d depends less on its story of a superstud running from the police than it does on its disinterest in referencing white culture and its radically new understanding of how style and substance inform each other,\u201d wrote Steven Higgins in \u201cStill Moving: The Film and Media Collections of the Museum of Modern Art.\u201d MoMA has preserve the film from its original camera negative.</p><p><strong>Wattstax (1973)     <br /></strong>Often called the \u201cBlack Woodstock,\u201d this documentary from Memphis\u2019 Stax Records stands as far more than simply a great concert film. \u201cWattstax\u201d chronicles the renowned 1972 LA Memorial Coliseum concert and celebrates the Los Angeles\u2019 black community\u2019s rebirth after the tragedy of the Watts riots a few years earlier. Richard Pryor\u2019s knowing monologues frame and serve as a Shakespearean musing on race relations and Black American life, alongside the incisive comments from people on the Watts streets. \u201cWattstax\u201d also features dazzling music highlights\u00a0 from artists such as Isaac Hayes and the Staple Singers, capped\u00a0 by Rufus Thomas dancing the Funky Chicken in hot pants.</p><p><strong>With Car and Camera Around the World (1929)                \u00a0 <br /></strong><span>Filmed from 1922 to 1929,\u00a0\u201cWith Car and Camera Around the World\u201d\u00a0(1929) documented the expeditions of Walter\u00a0</span><span>Wanderwell</span><span>\u00a0and Aloha\u00a0</span><span>Wanderwell</span><span>\u00a0Baker, the first woman to travel around the world by car.

The comic bits include a renowned pie-fighting sequence where the principle of \u201creciprocal destruction\u201d escalates to epic proportions. \u201cBattle\u201d offers a stark illustration of the detective work (and luck) required to locate and preserve films from the silent era. Only excerpts from reel two of the film had survived for many years. Critic Leonard Maltin discovered a mostly complete nitrate copy of reel one at the Museum of Modern Art in the 1970s. Then in 2015, film collector and silent film accompanist Jon Mirsalis located a complete version of reel two as part of a film collection he purchased from the Estate of Gordon Berkow. The film still lacks brief scenes from reel one, but the film is now almost complete, comprising elements from MoMA, the Library of Congress, UCLA and other sources. It was restored by the UCLA Film and Television Archive in conjunction with Jeff Joseph/SabuCat. The nearly complete film was preserved from one reel of 35mm nitrate print, one reel of a 35mm acetate dupe negative and a 16mm acetate print.

She reasoned that because the majority of movie fans were women, \u201cit follows that a member of the sex is best able to gauge their wants in the form of stories and plays.\u201d In an essay Park contributed to the book \u201cCareers for Women,\u201d she stated that women were advantaged as motion picture directors because of \u201cthe superiority of their emotional and imaginative faculties.\u201d In the two surviving reels of \u201cBread,\u201d one of only three films Park directed that are currently known to exist, she displays an accomplished ability to knowingly vivify her protagonist\u2019s plight as she fends off an attacker and places her frail hopes in a misshapen loaf of bread that has come to symbolize for her the good things in life.</p><p><strong>Buena Vista Social Club (1999)<br /></strong>\u201cThe best Wim Wenders documentary to date and an uncommonly self-effacing one, this 1999 concert movie about performance and lifestyle is comparable in some ways to \u2018Latcho Drom,\u2019 the great Gypsy documentary/musical. In 1996, musician Ry Cooder traveled to Havana to reunite some of the greatest stars of Cuban pop music from the Batista era (who were virtually forgotten after Castro came to power) with the aim of making a record, a highly successful venture that led to concerts in Amsterdam and New York. The players and their stories are as wonderful as the music, and the filmmaking is uncommonly sensitive and alert,\u201d wrote film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum.</p><p><strong>Cabin in the Sky (1943)<br /></strong>\u201cCabin\u201d tells the story of a man (Eddie \u201cRochester\u201d Anderson) trying to make it into heaven and who is sent back to earth for one last shot at redemption. Released the same year as Fox\u2019s \u201cStormy Weather,\u201d this film adaptation of the 1940 Broadway musical marked the directing debut of renowned director Vincente Minnelli (\u201cMeet Me in St. Louis,\u201d \u201cAn American in Paris,\u201d \u201cBad and the Beautiful,\u201d \u201cThe Band Wagon,\u201d and \u201cGigi\u201d). Minnelli\u2019s gift for ingeniously blending in dazzling musical numbers is on full display throughout. Lauded at the time for showcasing an all-Black cast in a major Hollywood film when many theaters in the U.S. were still segregated, the film also sadly demonstrates the limited film opportunities and acting compromises African Americans had to make during the Hollywood classic era. These notable concerns aside, \u201cCabin\u201d remains a glittering cultural record of outstanding African American artistic talent of the era (Ethel Waters, Lena Horne, Louis Armstrong, Rex Ingram, and Eddie \u201cRochester\u201d Anderson.)\u00a0</p><p><strong>A Clockwork Orange (1971)<br /></strong>Though based on the book by Anthony Burgess, it certainly took an eye and a mind like director Stanley Kubrick\u2019s to bring this film to life. Set in a not-so-distant future, that is equal parts dystopian and cartoonish, \u201cClockwork,\u201d now almost 50 years after its creation, remains as it always was: disturbing, controversial and startlingly unsettling. Malcolm MacDowell (in his most legendary role) stars as Alex DeLarge, the demented, de facto leader of a gang of boys-- sporting bowler hats, canes and codpieces--who wreak havoc all over what used to be England.\u00a0 But as evil as Alex is, when he\u2019s caught and subjected to a type of state-sanctioned crime aversion therapy, his \u201ctreatment\u201d turns out to be far more brutal than any of the crimes he\u2019s ever committed.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><strong>The Dark Knight (2008)<br /></strong>Bob Kane and Bill Finger\u2019s dark, enduring creation first flew onto the screen in a 1943 B-movie serial and would return to theaters several times in treatments both camp and action-oriented. But Christopher Nolan\u2019s evocative 2008 work reinvented the already vast Batman mythos thanks in no small part to its two intense, now legendary, lead performances:\u00a0 Christian Bale as the titular character and Heath Ledger, in a remarkable, Oscar-winning take on Bat super-villain \u201cThe Joker.\u201d\u00a0 Set in a dark, modern-day Gotham City, \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d is a visual feast of memorable set pieces, screenwriting flair, and characters and situations imbued with a soul and a conscience. \u201cPitched at the divide between art and industry, poetry and entertainment, \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d goes darker and deeper than any Hollywood movie of its comic-book kind,\u201d wrote Manohla Dargis of The New York Times. The theme of a world turned upside down by fear and dystopian chaos resonates eerily well in the pandemic havoc of 2020.</p><p><strong>The Devil Never Sleeps (1994)</strong><br />Early one Sunday morning in July, the filmmaker receives a phone call informing her that her beloved tio (uncle) Oscar Ruiz Almeida has been found dead of a gunshot wound to the head in Chihuahua, Mexico. His widow has declared his death a suicide. Most of his family, however, cry murder and point to a number of possible suspects: his business partner, his ranch-hand, the widow herself. In \u201cThe Devil Never Sleeps,\u201d Lourdes Portillo returns to the land of her birth to find out exactly who her uncle was and to investigate the circumstances of his death. She explores \"irrational\" as well as \"logical\" explanations, searching for clues on both sides of the border and in the history of her family. Old tales of betrayal, passion, lust and supernatural visitation emerge as we follow the filmmaker deep into the life of a community in the homeland of Pancho Villa. \u201cThe Devil Never Sleeps\u201d exposes the loves and hatreds of a Mexican family convulsed by the death of one of its members. The emotions that Portillo captures in her particular blend of traditional and experimental techniques bring out the nuances of Mexican social and family order. Poetic, tragic, humorous and mythic, this film crosses the borders of personal values, cultural mores and the discipline of filmmaking itself. It is a key film by a Latina filmmaker.</p><p><strong>Freedom Riders (2010)\u00a0\u00a0 <br /></strong>During 1961, more than 400 people from across the nation, black and white, women and men, old and young, challenged state-sanctioned segregation on buses and in bus terminals in the Deep South, segregation that continued after the Supreme Court had ruled the practice to be in violation of interstate commerce laws. Some 50 years later, \u201cFreedom Riders,\u201d a two-hour PBS American Experience documentary made by Stanley Nelson, charted their course in considerable depth as they faced savage retaliatory attacks and forced a reluctant federal government to back their cause. The riveting story is told without narration using archival film and stills and, most engagingly, through testimonies of the Freedom Riders themselves, journalists who followed their trail, federal, state, and local officials, white southerners, and chroniclers of the movement including Raymond Arsenault, whose book inspired the documentary. The film takes viewers through many complex twists and turns of the journey with extraordinary clarity and emotional force. The courage and conviction of the Freedom Riders, ordinary Americans willing to risk bodily harm and death to combat injustice nonviolently, will inspire later generations who watch Nelson\u2019s eloquent film. Nearly 50 full interviews conducted for the film are now available in the American Archive of Public Broadcasting at <a href=\"https://americanarchive.org/special_collections/freedom-riders-interviews\">https://americanarchive.org/special_collections/freedom-riders-interviews</a>.</p><p><strong>Grease (1978)<br /></strong>This tuneful, loving tribute to 1950s America \u2014 perhaps more romanticized than accurate \u2014 was first staged on Broadway in 1972. A huge hit, it would run for over 3,000 performances before closing in 1980. In 1978, the production was brought to the big screen with the addition of a few fresh songs and a cast including newly-minted superstar John Travolta and pop/country chanteuse Olivia Newton-John. Energetically directed by Randal Kleiser and loaded with beloved songs like \u201cYou\u2019re the One that I Want,\u201d \u201cWe Go Together,\u201d \u201cSummer Nights,\u201d \u201cHopelessly Devoted to You\u201d and \u201cGreased Lightin\u2019,\u201d \u201cGrease\u201d became the film of that year. It has never really left \u2014 becoming a staple for both local and high school productions, several Broadway revivals and even a live TV adaptation in 2016.\u00a0 \u201cGrease\u201d is still the word.</p><p><strong>The Ground (1993-2001)<br /></strong>The films of Robert Beavers are exceptional for their visual beauty, aural texture and depth of emotional expression. Beavers\u2019 films occupy a noble place within the history of avant-garde film, positioned at the intersection of structural and lyrical filmmaking traditions. They seem to embody the ideals of the Renaissance in their fascination with perception, psychology, literature, the natural world, architectural space, musical phrasing and aesthetic beauty. \u201cThe Ground<strong><em>\u201d</em></strong> uses seemingly simple components \u2014 the sunbaked landscape of a Greek island, the blue waters of the Aegean Sea and images of a man chiseling stone \u2014 to conjure the fundamental experience of holding something close to one\u2019s heart.</p><p><strong>The Hurt Locker (2008)<br /></strong>That great Hollywood staple, the \u201cwar movie,\u201d got a major reinvention in director Kathryn Bigelow\u2019s 2008 riveting and uncompromising look at contemporary warfare. Following the work of a Baghdad-based explosive ordnance disposal team, \u201cThe Hurt Locker\u201d strips away sentiment \u2014 and politics \u2014 to\u00a0 focus its camera on the rampant, second-by-second dangers and ethical dilemmas of modern-day soldiers. Jeremy Renner leads the skillful cast as a detonation expert for whom war seems a little too \u201cnormal.\u201d Along with winning that year\u2019s Best Picture Oscar, Bigelow was named as \u201cBest Director\u201d by the Academy, the first woman to receive that honor.</p><p><strong>Illusions (1982)<br /></strong>Born in New York City, Julie Dash is a filmmaker, music video and commercial director, author and website creator. Her film studies began in Harlem in 1969 but eventually led her to the American Film Institute and UCLA, where she made \u201c<em>The Diary of an African Nun\u201d</em><em>\u00a0</em>(1977), based on a short story by Alice Walker, which won a student award from the Directors Guild of America. Dash\u2019s critically acclaimed short film \u201c<em>Illusions\u201d</em> (1982) later won the Jury Prize for Best Film of the Decade awarded by the Black Filmmakers Foundation. Created for her MFA thesis at UCLA, \u201cIllusions, is set in World War II-era Hollywood and explores the nature of Hollywood racial politics, fantasy and the illusion of racial identity.</p><p><strong>The Joy Luck Club (1993)        \u00a0 <br /></strong>Director Wayne Wang's adaptation of Amy Tan's novel tells a story of relationships between Chinese-American women and their Chinese immigrant mothers.\u00a0 The four mothers meet weekly to play Mahjong, tell stories and reminisce. The richly layered plot features key themes including the often complicated relationships between mothers and daughters, assimilation into a far different culture, wistfulness for aspects of former lifestyles, the intersections between past and present, and the strong bond of family ties between two generations who grew up in vastly different circumstances.\u00a0 Wang\u2019s film \u201cChan Is Missing\u201d was selected to the National Film Registry in 1995.</p><p><strong>Kid Auto Races at Venice (1914)</strong><br />A milestone in film history, \u201cKid Auto Races at Venice\u201d features the debut of Charlie Chaplin\u2019s little tramp character as he continually disrupts a cameraman trying to film a soapbox derby car race. A contemporary review in The Cinema noted, \"Kid Auto Races struck us as about the funniest film we have ever seen. When we subsequently saw Chaplin in more ambitious efforts, our opinion that the Keystone Company had made the capture of their career was strengthened. Chaplin is a born screen comedian; he does things we have never seen done on the screen before.\u201d</p><p><strong>Lilies of the Field (1963) <br /></strong>From 1950 to 1980, Sidney Poitier ranked among the top American film stars (\u201cNo Way Out,\u201d \u201cBlackboard Jungle,\u201d \u201cEdge of the City,\u201d \u201cThe Defiant Ones,\u201d \u201cRaisin in the Sun,\u201d \u201cParis Blues,\u201d \u201cIn the Heat of the Night,\u201d \u201cGuess Who\u2019s Coming to Dinner\u201d). In \u201cLilies,\u201d Poitier has another of his classic roles where he plays an itinerant worker who helps refugee East European nuns build a chapel in Arizona. The nuns cannot pay him for the work and implore him to do so by citing various Biblical verses (Sermon on the Mount). Poitier, for his part, is moved by their plight but also wants to demonstrate his skills as an architect and builder. The film serves as a parable highlighting mutual respect via common purpose, the austere Arizona desert landscape, the impoverished nuns, and a man they believe God sent to help them. For his portrayal, Poitier became the first African American to win the Oscar for best actor.</p><p><strong>Losing Ground (1982)     <br /></strong>One of the first feature films directed by an African American woman, Kathleen Collins\u2019 \u201cLosing Ground\u201d tells the story of a marriage between two remarkable people, both at a crossroads in their lives.\u00a0\u201cLosing Ground\u201d centers on the experiences of Sara (Seret Scott), an African American philosophy professor whose artist husband Victor (Bill Gunn) rents a country house for a month to celebrate a recent museum sale. The couple\u2019s summer idyll becomes complicated as Sara struggles to research the philosophical and religious meaning of ecstatic experience ...and to discover it for herself.</p><p><strong>The Man With the Golden Arm (1955) <br /></strong>The subject of drug addiction has been addressed in Hollywood films many times before, dating all the way back to the silent era (Kevin Brownlow\u2019s seminal \u201cBehind the Mask of Innocence\u201d chronicles these amazing early productions). But few dared to be as honest, blunt or graphic as this Otto Preminger treatment, which featured Frank Sinatra and Kim Novak. Sinatra stars as the heroin-addicted hero who, having gotten clean while in prison, now struggles to remain \u201cstraight\u201d after release. Oscar-nominated for his work in the film, Sinatra is a raw nerve in his unvarnished portrayal of a \u201cjunkie,\u201d most memorably in his brutal withdrawal scenes. Along with its still topical subject and powerful storytelling, the film is further enhanced by its eye-popping Saul Bass opening credits sequence and Elmer Bernstein\u2019s remarkable jazz score. Critic Dave Kehr has noted that \u201cOtto Preminger's 1955 adaptation of Nelson Algren's novel is something of a crossroads movie, suspended between the swirling expressionism of Preminger's early career and the balanced realism that would later become his forte.\u201d\u00a0 The film was preserved by the Academy Film Archive in 2005 with funding from the Film Foundation and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association.</p><p><strong>Mauna Kea: Temple Under Siege (2006)        <br /></strong>Produced and directed by Puhipau and Joan Lander of N\u0101 Maka o ka \u02bb\u0100ina, this documentary about the dormant volcano on the Big Island of Hawai\u2019i examines the development vs. ecological preservation battle between scientists who use the mountain summit as an astronomical observatory and Hawaiians who want the mountain preserved as a cultural landscape sacred to the Hawaiian people.</p><p><strong>Outrage (1950)<br /></strong>For a few years beginning in the late 1940s, Ida Lupino, Hollywood\u2019s only woman director of the period, made a series of distinctive films that spoke to the public\u2019s desire, she stated, \u201cto see something that fits in with their own concepts of the way people actually live in the world and the problems they must meet and overcome.\u201d In \u201cOutrage,\u201d an unblinking examination of the traumatic effects of rape on a vulnerable young woman, Lupino, an actress of consummate grace and power, masterfully employed sound and silence, light and shadow, depth of field and cutting, camera movement and careful framing to cinematically capture the psychological impact of her character\u2019s shattered world. Inspired by a question that Italian neo-realist director Roberto Rossellini posed to her at a party \u2013 \u201cWhen are you going to make pictures about ordinary people, in ordinary situations\u201d \u2013 Lupino, along with her husband Collier Young, associate producer Malvin Wald, and cinematographer Archie Stout created a series of low-budget impactful films with newfound talent, like Mala Powers, star of \u201cOutrage.\u201d Lupino\u2019s films, Martin Scorsese has observed, \u201caddressed the wounded soul and traced the slow, painful process of women trying to wrestle with despair and reclaim their lives.\u201d</p><p><strong>Shrek (2001)                                            \u00a0\u00a0 <br /></strong>Even by DreamWorks standards, the charm and magic of \u201cShrek\u201d seemed extraordinary upon its initial release almost 20 years ago \u2014 and its power has yet to diminish in the intervening years. With this story of a green-skinned, solitude-loving ogre, Shrek, who embarks on a noble quest, alongside his new friend, a lovable donkey, the film manages to be both a send-up of fairy tale tropes and an affectionate tribute to them. Entertaining and emotionally impactful at levels to be appreciated by both children and their adults, \u201cShrek\u201d was a mega-hit upon its release and has been followed by three equally enchanting sequels, a TV holiday special and a Broadway adaption. Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy and Cameron Diaz lead the strong voice cast.</p><p><strong>Suspense (1913)\u00a0\u00a0 <br /></strong>During the 1910s, women directors played a prominent role in the development of film as an art form. Chief among them was Lois Weber who was recognized alongside directors such as D.W. Griffith and Cecil B. DeMille. Weber\u2019s films often touched on controversial social issues such as poverty and contraception.\u00a0 In a 1913 Photoplay interview, Weber spoke of her desire to create films \u201cthat will have an influence for good on the public mind.\u201d In this 1913 short, \u201cA wife and her baby are alone in an isolated house when a tramp breaks in. As the wife tries to keep the invader at bay, her husband happens to telephone and learn what\u2019s happening. He scrambles to return home. He steals an idle car, and its owner, accompanied by police, race after him. We cut rapidly between the besieged mother and the husband\u2019s frantic drive, as he is in turn pursued. Just as the tramp is about to attack the wife, the husband bursts in, followed by the police. The family is saved. This is the plot of \u201cSuspense,\u201d co-directed by Lois Weber and Phillips Smalley. If the plot sounds familiar, it\u2019s probably because you know that one of D.W. Griffith\u2019s most famous films, \u201cThe Lonely Villa\u201d (1909) tells the same basic tale. So Weber and Smalley are reviving an old idea. Their task is to make it fresh. How they do so has been studied in depth by Charlie Keil in his book \u201c<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Early-American-Cinema-Transition-Supervising/dp/029917364X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1217997344&amp;sr=8-1\">Early American Cinema in Transition: Story, Style, and Filmmaking, 1907-1913</a>,\u201d wrote film historian David Bordwell.</p><p><strong>Sweet Sweetback\u2019s Baadasssss Song (1971)<br /></strong>With \u201cSweet Sweetback,\u201d director Melvin Van Peebles touched off a wave of imitative Black features, few of which matched his startling originality and fierce attacks. The story of a male \u201cperformer\u201d at a ghetto bordello and his run from the law, the film shrewdly mixes commercial ingredients and ideological intent. \u201cIt would be difficult to underestimate Melvin Van Peebles's achievement in producing, directing, writing, scoring and starring in this film, not to mention financing it with the salary he had earned while directing \u201cWatermelon Man\u201d (1970). Not since Oscar Micheaux had an African American filmmaker taken such complete control of the creative process, turning out a work so deeply connected to his own personal and cultural reality that he was not surprised when the white critical establishment professed bewilderment upon its release in 1971. Filled with enough sex, rage and violence to earn it an X rating, the success of \u201cSweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song\u201d depends less on its story of a superstud running from the police than it does on its disinterest in referencing white culture and its radically new understanding of how style and substance inform each other,\u201d wrote Steven Higgins in \u201cStill Moving: The Film and Media Collections of the Museum of Modern Art.\u201d MoMA has preserve the film from its original camera negative.</p><p><strong>Wattstax (1973)     <br /></strong>Often called the \u201cBlack Woodstock,\u201d this documentary from Memphis\u2019 Stax Records stands as far more than simply a great concert film. \u201cWattstax\u201d chronicles the renowned 1972 LA Memorial Coliseum concert and celebrates the Los Angeles\u2019 black community\u2019s rebirth after the tragedy of the Watts riots a few years earlier. Richard Pryor\u2019s knowing monologues frame and serve as a Shakespearean musing on race relations and Black American life, alongside the incisive comments from people on the Watts streets. \u201cWattstax\u201d also features dazzling music highlights\u00a0 from artists such as Isaac Hayes and the Staple Singers, capped\u00a0 by Rufus Thomas dancing the Funky Chicken in hot pants.</p><p><strong>With Car and Camera Around the World (1929)                \u00a0 <br /></strong><span>Filmed from 1922 to 1929,\u00a0\u201cWith Car and Camera Around the World\u201d\u00a0(1929) documented the expeditions of Walter\u00a0</span><span>Wanderwell</span><span>\u00a0and Aloha\u00a0</span><span>Wanderwell</span><span>\u00a0Baker, the first woman to travel around the world by car.

Our camera is focused looking up Pennsylvania Avenue and shows countless thousands of mourning people who line the streets along the way. As the funeral procession which accompanies the body of our martyred President approaches, our camera is set in motion and pictures of the marching multitude who pay the last tribute to President McKinley at our National Capitol are recorded in the following order. The line is headed by a troop of U.S. Cavalry, followed by detachments of heavy artillery; then comes the Loyal Legion, followed by G. A. R. detachments, made up of both Federal and Confederate veterans. Next in order comes the Guard of Honor, who are in turn followed by the hearse, which is drawn by six black-plumed and black-netted horses. Inside the hearse can be seen the flag covered casket. The light and color of the procession is suddenly gone; spectators silently bow and bare their heads. The pageant has suddenly been transformed into a funeral cortege. Our position was so excellent that as the hearse passed our camera a distinct and life-size view was procured, showing this vehicle of sadness in all its detail. The hearse is closely followed by the Admirals of the Navy and the Generals of the Army. Next in order come the carriages of the family and the relatives, and then the carriage of President Roosevelt, which is drawn by four black horses. Next come the carriages which contain the President's Cabinet, the Diplomatic Corps, Chief Justice Fuller and Associate Justices, Senators, Congressman, Governors of States and Government Officials. These carriages are followed by the United States Marine Band, which forms a most imposing spectacle as it marches slowly and solemnly to the strains of \"Nearer My God to Thee\". Following the United States Marine Band and in step with the slow funeral march comes the National Guard of the District of Columbia and sailors from United States Battleships, clad in their natty uniforms and jackey hats. The sailors and soldiers are marching sixteen abreast and make a very imposing spectacle as they pass our camera. The procession having passed, the crowd immediately surges toward the Capitol, intent on securing a place in the line that they may enter the rotunda and look upon the face of the illustrious President McKinley. Our panoramic device is then set in motion and a most perfect and interesting picture is secured as an ending to the Washington film. The picture shows the immense crowds surging toward the Capitol, and as rain begins falling at that moment tens of thousands of umbrellas are raised for protection. Our camera having been above the heads of the people, a most novel effect is secured.
