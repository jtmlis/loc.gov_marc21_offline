VALUE FOR MULTIPLE SURNAMES IN MARC 21</B></font>
</center>
<p>
<strong>BACKGROUND</strong>
<p>
     In 1996, the first indicator value 2 (Multiple surname) in X00 fields in MARC 21 was made
obsolete. 
Value 1 (Single surname) was redefined as "surname" to be used for headings with either single or
multiple
surnames.  At the time value 2 was made obsolete, various factors contributed to a delay in
implementation,
including, more recently, the installation of the LC ILS. (By exception, the change was
implemented by the
British Library and three NACO libraries (National Library of Scotland, Cambridge, and Oxford)
linked with
the BL in a UK cooperative called the Copyright Libraries Shared Cataloguing Programme
(CLSC), and the
UK's National Art Library.  Authority records contributed by the Dance Heritage Coalition also
contained the
change.)
<p>
     Now that the LC ILS has been installed, LC assessed the best way to implement this change
within
the context of available resources.  After consulting various libraries and agencies about the
proposed
implementation plan, LC has decided to implement the change beginning January 1, 2000
according to the
following guidelines for LC/NACO libraries.
<p>
<strong>BASIS OF IMPLEMENTATION</strong>
<p>
      The basis of the implementation of the indicator change is that authority and
bibliographic
records will be treated independently, i.e., there will be no attempt to keep authority and
bibliographic records
in synchronization.  The goals of the implementation are to assure that:
<ol>
<li>
all newly created authority and bibliographic records reflect the change;
          <li>all existing records that are changed will be consistent within themselves.
          </ol>
          <p>
          <strong>APPLICABILITY</strong>
          <p>
                The guidelines apply to fields 100, 400, and 500 in all authority records
(name, series,
          subjects).  They apply to the following fields in bibliographic records: 100; 400; 600; 700;
          800.
          <p>
          <strong>GUIDELINES</strong>
          <ol> 
          <li>
          <strong>Newly created records.</strong>  Discontinue using value 2 in newly created
authority and
          bibliographic records.
          <p>
          <li>
          <strong>Existing records.</strong>  Limit changes to those encountered in regular work. 
Do not look for
          changes in the indicator value per se.
          <p>
          2.1. <i>Authority records.</i>  If changing an authority record that contains one or more
multiple surname
          fields with Indicator 1 = 2, change the value 2 to 1 in all such fields as needed.
          <p>
          2.1.1. <i>Corresponding bibliographic records.</i> Do not change corresponding
bibliographic records unless
          there is another reason for changing them, in which case change the value 2 to 1 in all
          candidate fields as needed.
          <p>
          2.1.2 <i>Related authority records.</i>  Do not extend the changes stimulated by a
particular  authority
          record to related authority records unless there is another reason for changing them, in
which
          case change the value 2 to 1 in all candidate fields as needed .
          <p>
          2.2 <i>Bibliographic records.</i>  If changing a bibliographic record for some other reason
and that record
          contains one or more multiple surname fields with Indicator 1 = 2, change the value 2 to 1
in
          all such fields as needed.
          <p>
          2.2.1 <i>Corresponding authority records.</i>  Do not change corresponding authority
records unless there is
          another reason for changing them, in which case change the value 2 to 1 in all candidate
          fields as needed.
          <p>
          2.2.2 <i>Related bibliographic records.</i>  Do not extend the changes stimulated by a
particular
          bibliographic record to related bibliographic records unless there is another reason for
          changing them, in which case change the value 2 to 1 in all candidate fields as needed.
