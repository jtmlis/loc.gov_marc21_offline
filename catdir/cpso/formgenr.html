          During the five months since the last LC update report in New Orleans, competing
priorities, especially ILS planning, continue to limit LC's planning and implementation of
form/genre subject access.  The following is an update of activities and the LC form/genre
implementation schedule:<P> 

          <B>Data elements in authority records</B>.  The Library of Congress has completed the first series of systems tests of the
additional data elements approved by MARBI for name and subject authority records as part of
updates 1 and 2.  The remaining testing is expected to be completed by the end of August 1998.<P>

          <B>Subdivision authority records (18X).</B>  LC will be creating <A HREF="http://lcweb.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/subdauth.html">subdivision authority records</A> for approximately 3,000 form, topical, and chronological free-floating subdivisions, based on an authority file created by Gary Strawn of Northwestern University.  It is estimated that distribution of these new subdivision authority records will
begin in autumn 1998.  A more specific date announcement will be made as the time of actual
distribution approaches.
<P>
          <B>Subfield code $v</B>.  Form subdivisions appearing in existing subject authority
records will be recoded from $x to $v.  Distribution of these revised records will also begin in autumn 1998, at the same time as the new subdivision records described above.  Staff in the
Cataloging Policy and Support Office will draft guidelines and update documentation on form
sudivisions and the application of subfield code $v in bibliographic records.  These guidelines
will be included in 1998 Update Number 2 to the <CITE>Subject Cataloging Manual: Subject Headings</CITE>,
scheduled for publication in autumn 1998.
<P>
          According to current projections, LC staff will begin coding form subdivisions
as $v in LC subject headings assigned to bibliographic records no earlier than November 1,
1998.  The Library will make further announcements as the date of actual application
approaches.
<P>
          Form subdivisions coded as $v are already appearing in LC bibliographic records
in subject headings assigned by the National Library of Medicine from <CITE>Medical Subject Headings</CITE>
(MeSh) to cooperative monographic and serial records, and in form/genre headings assigned
from the <CITE><A HREF="http://lcweb.loc.gov/rr/mopic/migintro.html">Moving Image Genre-Form
Guide</A></CITE> to records for moving-image materials.  In addition,
some records used for copy cataloging purposes and distributed by LC (042 = lccopycat) contain
$v in non-LCSH subject strings.
<P>
          <B>Authority records for form/genre headings (155</B>).  Creation of authority records
for form/genre headings in 155 fields and more widespread assignment of form/genre terms in
655 fields of bibliographic records will occur in future stages of the form/genre implementation
plan and may be phased in by format or discipline.  The Library is not yet projecting any
specific dates for these future stages of implementation.
<P>
          <B>Cartographic materials</B>.  In the process of cataloging digital cartographic material,
the Geography and Map Division has experimented with the use of an uncontrolled index term
(Maps--Digital) for form/genre access in field 653.  The Geography and Map Division is
considering establishing this phrase in <CITE>LCSH</CITE>.
<P>
          <B>Moving-image materials.</B>  The Motion Picture, Broadcasting and Recorded Sound
Division, Moving Image Section has been assigning terms from its <CITE><A HREF="http://lcweb.loc.gov/rr/mopic/migintro.html">Moving Image Genre-Form
Guide</A></CITE> (MIGFG) since October 1997.  The guide's 150 genre and form terms have been applied to around
8,000 inventory and cataloging records created in the Division--all types of material, features,
television, film, and video.  "Migfg" is the subject/index term source code used in the 655 field.
