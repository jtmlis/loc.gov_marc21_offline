                  <p>Out of an abundance of caution, all Library of Congress buildings and facilities will be closed to the public starting at 5 p.m. Thursday, March 12, until further notice to reduce the risk of transmitting COVID-19 coronavirus. Consequently, the Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) will not be receiving courier deliveries during this period. Members of the public are strongly encouraged to file all documents with the CRB electronically through eCRB, the CRB’s electronic filing and case management system, at <a target="_blank" href="https://app.crb.gov/">https://app.crb.gov</a>. The CRB will continue to operate, but all hearings scheduled to begin during that period will be postponed.</p>

                  <p class="text-left">The Copyright Royalty and Distribution Reform Act of 2004 (CRDRA) established the Copyright Royalty Judges program in the Library of Congress. The Copyright Royalty Judges (Judges) oversee the copyright law’s statutory licenses, which permit qualified parties to use multiple copyrighted works without obtaining separate licenses from each copyright owner.</p>
                  <p class="text-left">The Judges determine and adjust royalty rates and terms applicable to the statutory copyright licenses. They also oversee distribution of royalties deposited with the Copyright Office by certain statutory licensees and adjudicate controversies relating to the distributions.</p>
                  <p class="text-left">The Judges are appointed by the Librarian of Congress to serve staggered six-year terms. Each may be reappointed to subsequent six-year terms.</p>
                  <p class="text-left">Under the CRDRA, each judge must have a law degree and at least seven years’ legal experience.  In addition, one judge must have significant knowledge of copyright law, one must have significant knowledge of economics, and one must have a minimum of five years’ judicial or quasi-judicial experience. The board of Judges consists of <a data-toggle="modal" data-target="#feder">Judge Jesse M. Feder</a> (chief judge), <a data-toggle="modal" data-target="#strickler">Judge David R. Strickler</a> (economics), and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-19-101/librarian-of-congress-names-new-copyright-royalty-judge/2019-10-18/">Judge Steve Ruwe</a> (copyright). Judge Feder’s current term ends in January 2024; Judge Strickler’s current term ends in January 2022; and Judge Ruwe’s current term ends in December 2025.</p>
